<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It is very seldom that the preface of a work is read; indeed,
of late years most books have been sent into the world without
any.&nbsp; I deem it, however, advisable to write a preface, and
to this I humbly call the attention of the courteous reader, as
its perusal will not a little tend to the proper understanding
and appreciation of these volumes.</p>
<p>The work now offered to the public, and which is styled <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, consists of a narrative of what occurred to
me during a residence in that country, to which I was sent by the
Bible Society, as its agent, for the purpose of printing and
circulating the Scriptures.&nbsp; It comprehends, however,
certain journeys and adventures in Portugal, and leaves me at
last in &ldquo;the land of the <i>Corahai</i>,&rdquo; to which
region, after having undergone considerable buffeting in Spain, I
found it expedient to retire for a season.</p>
<p>It is very probable that had I visited Spain from mere
curiosity, or with a view of passing a year or two agreeably, I
should never have attempted to give any detailed account of my
proceedings, or of what I heard and saw.&nbsp; I am no tourist,
no writer of books of travels; but I went there on a somewhat
remarkable errand, which necessarily led me into strange
situations and positions, involved me in difficulties and
perplexities, and brought me into contact with people of all
descriptions and grades; so that, upon <a name="pageiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>the whole, I flatter myself that a
narrative of such a pilgrimage may not be wholly uninteresting to
the public, more especially as the subject is not trite; for,
though various books have been published about Spain, I believe
that the present is the only one in existence which treats of
missionary labour in that country.</p>
<p>Many things, it is true, will be found in the following volume
which have little connexion with religion, or religious
enterprise; I offer, however, no apology for introducing
them.&nbsp; I was, as I may say, from first to last adrift in
Spain, the land of old renown, the land of wonder and mystery,
with better opportunities of becoming acquainted with its strange
secrets and peculiarities than, perhaps, ever yet were afforded
to any individual, certainly to a foreigner; and if in many
instances I have introduced scenes and characters perhaps
unprecedented in a work of this description, I have only to
observe, that, during my sojourn in Spain, I was so unavoidably
mixed up with such, that I could scarcely have given a faithful
narrative of what befell me had I not brought them forward in the
manner in which I have done.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that, called suddenly and unexpectedly
&ldquo;to undertake the adventure of Spain,&rdquo; I was not
altogether unprepared for such an enterprise.&nbsp; In the
day-dreams of my boyhood, Spain always bore a considerable share,
and I took a particular interest in her, without any presentiment
that I should, at a future time, be called upon to take a part,
however humble, in her strange dramas; which interest, at a very
early period, led me to acquire her noble language, and to make
myself acquainted with her literature (scarcely worthy of the
language), her history, and traditions; so that when I entered
Spain for the first time I felt more at home than I should
otherwise have done.</p>
<p><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>In Spain
I passed five years, which, if not the most eventful, were, I
have no hesitation in saying, the most happy years of my
existence.&nbsp; Of Spain at the present time, now that the
day-dream has vanished never, alas! to return, I entertain the
warmest admiration: she is the most magnificent country in the
world, probably the most fertile, and certainly with the finest
climate.&nbsp; Whether her children are worthy of their mother,
is another question, which I shall not attempt to answer; but
content myself with observing that, amongst much that is
lamentable and reprehensible, I have found much that is noble and
to be admired: much stern heroic virtue; much savage and horrible
crime; of low vulgar vice very little, at least amongst the great
body of the Spanish nation, with which my mission lay; for it
will be as well here to observe that I advance no claim to an
intimate acquaintance with the Spanish nobility, from whom I kept
as remote as circumstances would permit me; <i>en revanche</i>,
however, I have had the honour to live on familiar terms with the
peasants, shepherds, and muleteers of Spain, whose bread and
<i>bacallao</i> I have eaten; who always treated me with kindness
and courtesy, and to whom I have not unfrequently been indebted
for shelter and protection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The generous bearing of Francisco Gonzales,
and the high deeds of Ruy Diaz the Cid, are still sung amongst
the fastnesses of the Sierra Morena.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that no stronger argument can be brought forward in
proof of the natural vigour and resources of Spain, and the
sterling character of her population, than the fact that, at the
present day, she is still a powerful and unexhausted country, and
her children still, to a certain extent, a high-minded and great
<a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>people.&nbsp; Yes, notwithstanding the misrule of the
brutal and sensual Austrian, the doting Bourbon, and, above all,
the spiritual tyranny of the court of Rome, Spain can still
maintain her own, fight her own combat, and Spaniards are not yet
fanatic slaves and crouching beggars.&nbsp; This is saying much,
very much: she has undergone far more than Naples had ever to
bear, and yet the fate of Naples has not been hers.&nbsp; There
is still valour in Asturia, generosity in Aragon, probity in Old
Castile, and the peasant women of La Mancha can still afford to
place a silver fork and a snowy napkin beside the plate of their
guest.&nbsp; Yes, in spite of Austrian, Bourbon, and Rome, there
is still a wide gulf between Spain and Naples.</p>
<p>Strange as it may sound, Spain is not a fanatic country. <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a>&nbsp; I know something about her, and
declare that she is not, nor has ever been: Spain never
changes.&nbsp; It is true that, for nearly two centuries, she was
the she-butcher, <i>La Verduga</i>, of malignant Rome; the chosen
instrument for carrying into effect the atrocious projects of
that power; yet fanaticism was not the spring which impelled her
to the work of butchery: another feeling, in her the predominant
one, was worked upon&mdash;her fatal pride.&nbsp; It was by
humouring her pride that she was induced to waste her precious
blood and treasure in the Low Country wars, to launch the Armada,
and to many other equally insane actions.&nbsp; Love of Rome had
ever slight influence over her policy; but, flattered by the
title of <i>Gonfaloniera of the Vicar of Jesus</i>, and eager to
prove herself not unworthy of the same, she shut her eyes, and
rushed upon her own destruction with the cry of &ldquo;Charge,
Spain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the arms of Spain became powerless abroad, <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>and she
retired within herself.&nbsp; She ceased to be the tool of the
vengeance and cruelty of Rome.&nbsp; She was not cast aside,
however.&nbsp; No! though she could no longer wield the sword
with success against the Lutherans, she might still be turned to
some account.&nbsp; She had still gold and silver, and she was
still the land of the vine and olive.&nbsp; Ceasing to be the
butcher, she became the banker of Rome; and the poor Spaniards,
who always esteem it a privilege to pay another person&rsquo;s
reckoning, were for a long time happy in being permitted to
minister to the grasping cupidity of Rome, who, during the last
century, probably extracted from Spain more treasure than from
all the rest of Christendom.</p>
<p>But wars came into the land.&nbsp; Napoleon and his fierce
Franks invaded Spain; plunder and devastation ensued, the effects
of which will probably be felt for ages.&nbsp; Spain could no
longer pay pence to Peter so freely as of yore, and from that
period she became contemptible in the eyes of Rome, who has no
respect for a nation, save so far as it can minister to her
cruelty or avarice.&nbsp; The Spaniard was still willing to pay,
as far as his means would allow, but he was soon given to
understand that he was a degraded being,&mdash;a barbarian; nay,
a beggar.&nbsp; Now you may draw the last <i>cuarto</i> from a
Spaniard, provided you will concede to him the title of cavalier,
and rich man, for the old leaven still works as powerfully as in
the time of the first Philip; <a name="citation0c"></a><a
href="#footnote0c" class="citation">[0c]</a> but you must never
hint that he is poor, or that his blood is inferior to your
own.&nbsp; And the old peasant, on being informed in what slight
estimation he was held, replied, &ldquo;If I am a beast, a
barbarian, and a beggar withal, I am sorry for it; but, as there
is no remedy, I shall spend these four bushels of barley, which I
had reserved to alleviate the misery of the <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>holy
father, in procuring bull spectacles, and other convenient
diversions, for the queen my wife, and the young princes my
children.&nbsp; Beggar! <i>carajo</i>!&nbsp; The water of my
village is better than the wine of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see that in a late pastoral letter directed to the
Spaniards, the father of Rome complains bitterly of the treatment
which he has received in Spain at the hands of naughty men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My cathedrals are let down,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my
priests are insulted, and the revenues of my bishops are
curtailed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He consoles himself, however, with the
idea, that this is the effect of the malice of a few, and that
the generality of the nation love him, especially the peasantry,
the innocent peasantry, who shed tears when they think of the
sufferings of their Pope and their religion.&nbsp; Undeceive
yourself, <i>Batuschca</i>, undeceive yourself!&nbsp; Spain was
ready to fight for you so long as she could increase her own
glory by doing so; but she took no pleasure in losing battle
after battle on your account.&nbsp; She had no objection to pay
money into your coffers in the shape of alms, expecting, however,
that the same would be received with the gratitude and humility
which become those who accept charity.&nbsp; Finding, however,
that you were neither humble nor grateful; suspecting, moreover,
that you held Austria in higher esteem than herself, even as a
banker, she shrugged up her shoulders, and uttered a sentence
somewhat similar to that which I have already put into the mouth
of one of her children, &ldquo;These four bushels of
barley,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>It is truly surprising what little interest the great body of
the Spanish nation took in the late struggle; and yet it has been
called by some, who ought to know better, a war of religion and
principle.&nbsp; It was generally supposed that Biscay was the
stronghold of Carlism, and that the inhabitants were fanatically
<a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>attached
to their religion, which they apprehended was in danger.&nbsp;
The truth is, that the Basques cared nothing for Carlos or Rome,
and merely took up arms to defend certain rights and privileges
of their own. <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a>&nbsp; For the dwarfish brother of
Ferdinand they always exhibited supreme contempt, which his
character, a compound of imbecility, cowardice, and cruelty, well
merited.&nbsp; If they made use of his name, it was merely as a
<i>cri de guerre</i>.&nbsp; Much the same may be said with
respect to his Spanish partisans, at least those who appeared in
the field for him.&nbsp; These, however, were of a widely
different character from the Basques, who were brave soldiers and
honest men.&nbsp; The Spanish armies of Don Carlos were composed
entirely of thieves and assassins, chiefly Valencians and
Manchegans, who, marshalled under two cutthroats, Cabrera and
Palillos, took advantage of the distracted state of the country
to plunder and massacre the honest part of the community.&nbsp;
With respect to the Queen Regent Christina, of whom the less said
the better, the reins of government fell into her hands on the
decease of her husband, and with them the command of the
soldiery.&nbsp; The respectable part of the Spanish nation, and
more especially the honourable and toil-worn peasantry, loathed
and execrated both factions.&nbsp; Oft when I was sharing at
nightfall the frugal fare of the villager of Old or New Castile,
on hearing the distant shot of the <i>Cristino</i> soldier or
Carlist bandit, he would invoke curses on the heads of the two
pretenders, not forgetting the holy father and the goddess of
Rome, <i>Maria Sant&iacute;sima</i>.&nbsp; Then, with the tiger
energy of the Spaniard when roused, he would start up and
exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Vamos</i>, <i>Don Jorge</i> to the plain, to
the plain!&nbsp; I wish to enlist with <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>you, and to learn the law of the
English.&nbsp; To the plain, therefore, to the plain to-morrow,
to circulate the gospel of Inglaterra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst the peasantry of Spain I found my sturdiest
supporters; and yet the holy father supposes that the Spanish
labourers are friends and lovers of his.&nbsp; Undeceive
yourself, <i>Batuschca</i>!</p>
<p>But to return to the present work: it is devoted to an account
of what befell me in Spain whilst engaged in distributing the
Scripture.&nbsp; With respect to my poor labours, I wish here to
observe that I accomplished but very little, and that I lay claim
to no brilliant successes and triumphs; indeed, I was sent into
Spain more to explore the country, and to ascertain how far the
minds of the people were prepared to receive the truths of
Christianity, than for any other object; I obtained, however,
through the assistance of kind friends, permission from the
Spanish government to print an edition of the sacred volume at
Madrid, which I subsequently circulated in that capital and in
the provinces.</p>
<p>During my sojourn in Spain there were others who wrought good
service in the Gospel cause, and of whose efforts it were unjust
to be silent in a work of this description.&nbsp; Base is the
heart which would refuse merit its meed; and, however
insignificant may be the value of any eulogium which can flow
from a pen like mine, I cannot refrain from mentioning with
respect and esteem a few names connected with Gospel
enterprise.&nbsp; A zealous Irish gentleman, of the name of
Graydon, <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a> exerted himself with indefatigable
diligence in diffusing the light of Scripture in the province of
Catalonia, and along the southern shores <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>of Spain;
whilst two missionaries from Gibraltar, Messrs. Rule <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a> and Lyon, <a name="citation0g"></a><a
href="#footnote0g" class="citation">[0g]</a> during one entire
year, preached Evangelic truth in a church at Cadiz.&nbsp; So
much success attended the efforts of these two last, brave
disciples of the immortal Wesley, that there is every reason for
supposing that, had they not been silenced, and eventually
banished from the country, by the pseudo-liberal faction of the
<i>Moderados</i>, not only Cadiz, but the greater part of
Andalusia, would by this time have confessed the pure doctrines
of the Gospel, and have discarded for ever the last relics of
Popish superstition.</p>
<p>More immediately connected with the Bible Society and myself,
I am most happy to take this opportunity of speaking of Luis de
Usoz y Rio, <a name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a> the scion of an ancient and honourable
family of Old Castile, my coadjutor whilst editing the Spanish
New Testament at Madrid.&nbsp; Throughout my residence in Spain I
experienced every mark of friendship from this gentleman, <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>who, during
the periods of my absence in the provinces, and my numerous and
long journeys, cheerfully supplied my place at Madrid, and
exerted himself to the utmost in forwarding the views of the
Bible Society, influenced by no other motive than a hope that its
efforts would eventually contribute to the peace, happiness, and
civilization of his native land.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I beg leave to state that I am fully aware of
the various faults and inaccuracies of the present work.&nbsp; It
is founded on certain journals which I kept during my stay in
Spain, and numerous letters written to my friends in England,
which they had subsequently the kindness to restore; the greater
part, however, consisting of descriptions of scenery, sketches of
character, etc., has been supplied from memory.&nbsp; In various
instances I have omitted the names of places, which I have either
forgotten, or of whose orthography I am uncertain.&nbsp; The
work, as it at present exists, was written in a solitary hamlet
in a remote part of England, where I had neither books to
consult, nor friends of whose opinion or advice I could
occasionally avail myself, and under all the disadvantages which
arise from enfeebled health.&nbsp; I have, however, on a recent
occasion, experienced too much of the lenity and generosity of
the public, both of Britain and America, to shrink from again
exposing myself to its gaze; and trust that, if in the present
volumes it find but little to admire, it will give me credit for
good spirit, and for setting down nought in malice.</p>

1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<p>When George Borrow, in the month of November, 1835, steamed up
the Tagus on his adventurous journey to distribute the Bible in
Spain, the political situation throughout the Peninsula was so
complicated and so extraordinary, that a brief review of the
events of the few years immediately preceding his arrival will be
necessary to enable any one but a specially instructed reader to
appreciate, or even to understand, his position and his
adventures.</p>
<p>When Ferdinand VII. was restored to his kingdom by the British
arms in 1814, Spain was still governed by the Cortes elected
under the Liberal Constitution of 1812.</p>
<p>Ferdinand, having sworn many oaths to maintain this
Constitution and Parliamentary Institutions in the country, no
sooner found himself firmly seated on the throne, than,
encouraged by the clergy within his dominions, and by the Holy
Alliance in Northern Europe, he issued an edict dissolving the
Cortes, and reviving the old absolutism with all the old abuses
in Spain.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The
nobles were once again exempted from taxation; the monasteries
were restored; the Jesuits returned to Spain; the Inquisition was
formally re-established; all Liberal politicians were persecuted
to the death.&nbsp; For six years this royalist reign of
terror&mdash;more dreadful by far than the <i>Terreur blanche</i>
in contemporary France&mdash;was continued, until at length, the
great American colonies having asserted their independence, <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> the standard of revolt was raised in
Spain by Riego and Quiroga, two officers in command of an
expedition which was just about to sail from Cadiz to renew the
war against the colonists in South America in January,
1820.&nbsp; The success of this political revolution was prompt
and complete.&nbsp; In March the king gave way, and once more
accepted the Constitution of 1812; and an administration of
moderate reformers was formed under Martinez de la Rosa, a
well-known man of letters, and was generally acceptable to the
country.</p>
<p>After much intrigue and factious opposition, both on the part
of the extreme Royalists and the extreme Radicals, the election
of Riego to the Presidency of the Cortes in 1822 marked the
extreme limit of the triumph of the Liberal party in Spain.</p>
<p>The Congress of Verona in October, 1822; the growing
pretensions of the Holy Alliance; the mission of the Duke of
Wellington, with George Canning&rsquo;s protest against the armed
intervention of any of the Powers in the domestic affairs of the
Peninsula; and the ultimate invasion of Spain by a French army of
100,000 men under the Duc d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, eldest son <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>of the Comte
d&rsquo;Artois, afterwards Charles X., in April,
1823;&mdash;these things belong as much to European as to Spanish
history, and need only be referred to in passing.</p>
<p>The French army, as may be supposed, met with no serious
opposition.&nbsp; Madrid was easily occupied before the end of
May.&nbsp; Cadiz, maintaining a brief but honourable resistance,
yielded to a bombardment in September; and Ferdinand VII.,
reinvested with absolute power over his subjects by foreign
artillery and foreign bayonets in October, 1823, immediately
unswore all his oaths, and restored all the old tyranny and
abuses in Spain.&nbsp; Riego was at once put to death.&nbsp; All
Liberals and even <i>moderados</i> were exposed to a sanguinary
and relentless persecution.&nbsp; The leaders and their richer
and more important partisans were as a rule able to make good
their flight, in many cases to England; but their humbler
followers paid the penalty of their liberalism with their
lives.&nbsp; The French army of occupation remained in Spain for
four years&mdash;1823&ndash;1827&mdash;and Cadiz was not
evacuated until 1828.</p>
<p>In September, 1824, Charles X. succeeded the more liberal
Louis XVIII. on the throne of France, and George Canning, unable
to compel or persuade the French to leave the Spanish people to
themselves in Spain, &ldquo;called a new world into existence to
restore the balance in the old,&rdquo; and recognized the
independence of the Spanish American colonies.</p>
<p>In 1829 Ferdinand VII. married, as his fourth wife, Maria
Christina of Naples, a sister of the Duchesse de Berri; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> and on October 10, 1830, the queen gave
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>birth to a
daughter, who was christened Isabella, afterwards so well known
as Isabel II. of Spain. <a name="citation4a"></a><a
href="#footnote4a" class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; The king, her
father, immediately issued a Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the
Salic law to be of no effect in Spain; and the young princess was
accordingly recognized as heir-apparent to the crown.&nbsp; A
formal protest was made by King Ferdinand&rsquo;s younger
brother, Don Carlos, who found himself thus excluded from the
succession, against this decree, and who soon afterwards quitted
Spain.</p>
<p>On Michaelmas Day, 1833, Ferdinand VII. died, and his daughter
Isabella was immediately proclaimed queen, as Isabel II., with
her mother Do&ntilde;a Cristina as regent, <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> of Spain throughout Spain.</p>
<p>Don Carlos, who had taken refuge in Portugal, found himself
unable to cross the frontier, and was constrained to make his way
from Lisbon by sea to London, and thence by way of France into
the Basque provinces, where he arrived in September, 1834.&nbsp;
Thus were founded the Carlist and the <i>Cristino</i> parties;
and on the side of the former were at once ranged all the
Basques, and the representatives of the absolutist and
ultra-clerical party throughout Spain.</p>
<p>Don Carlos himself, unable to cross the frontier, <a
name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a> <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>made his way from Portugal to England,
and thence through France (May, 1834), where his pretensions were
not unfavourably regarded, into Northern Spain (September,
1834).&nbsp; Mendizabal, a Cadiz Jew of much financial skill, who
had acquired great experience and some consideration in England
during his exile from 1823 to 1833, became Prime Minister of the
Regency.</p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>
<p>On the outbreak of hostilities in the north-west, the most
capable commander on the side of the Carlists was the Basque,
Tom&aacute;s Zumalacarregui.&nbsp; Born at Ormastegui, in
Guipuzcoa, in 1788, he had served in the Spanish army from 1808
to 1831 without finding any special favour or advancement from
king or Cortes.&nbsp; Dismissed the service in 1831, he emerged
from his retirement on the death of Ferdinand VII. in 1833, and,
openly attaching himself to the Carlist fortunes, he took the
field against the queen&rsquo;s troops at the head of some eight
hundred partisans.&nbsp; So great was his zeal and energy, and so
popular was Zumalacarregui himself in his native Guipuzcoa, that
in less than a year this little force had grown in his hands into
an army of over thirty-five thousand men, superior not only in
fighting qualities, but even in discipline, to any of the
queen&rsquo;s forces, fairly armed, and well supplied with food
and clothing.</p>
<p>But in spite of his commanding qualities, which made him
indispensable to the Carlist cause, the success of the blunt and
robust soldier excited the jealousy, not only of his subordinate
commanders, and of the priests and women who had so great an <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>influence at
the court of Don Carlos, but even of the Pretender himself.</p>
<p>The only general who may be compared with Zumalacarregui on
the Carlist side was born at Tortosa, at the mouth of the Ebro,
as late as December, 1806, and was thus nearly twenty years
younger than the Basque commander.</p>
<p>Cabrera was destined for the priesthood, and actually received
the <i>tonsura</i> in 1825, but in 1833 he quitted the convent of
the <i>Trinitarios</i> at Tortosa and joined the Carlist army
near the historic mountain fortress of Morella in November, 1833;
and in less than twelve months he had been appointed a colonel in
the Carlist army in Aragon.</p>
<p>On the side of the Constitutionalists there was no display of
military talent, or even of capacity.&nbsp; Rodil, Amildez, Mina,
Valdez, followed each other without advantage to the
queen&rsquo;s cause, and in spite of all the advantages incident
to a regular government, with command of the capital and all the
departments, little or no advantage was gained by the
Constitutional forces for long after the first outbreak of
hostilities.&nbsp; The war, however, was carried on by both
<i>Cristinos</i> and Carlists with the utmost savagery.</p>
<p>The wholesale massacre of wounded and prisoners by both the
<i>Cristino</i> and Carlist generals aroused the indignation of
every civilized community, and especially in England, where an
uneasy sense of responsibility for the atrocities which were
committed was natural in view of the fact that the government had
taken to some extent an official part in the war, and that
English regiments were soon to be exposed to the cruelties
against which the whole of Europe was protesting.&nbsp; The
pressure of public opinion in <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>England, indeed, was so strong that at
length Lord Eliot was despatched to Spain to negotiate a
convention between the belligerents which would ensure the
ordinary laws of civilized warfare being obeyed.&nbsp; It was a
difficult task. <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a></p>
<p>But by the exertions of Lord Eliot and Colonel Wylde of the
Royal Artillery, who was serving as a kind of military
<i>attach&eacute;</i> at the head-quarters of the queen&rsquo;s
forces, a convention, known as the &ldquo;Eliot
Convention,&rdquo; was at length signed by Zumalacarregui at or
near Logro&ntilde;o, on April 27 and 28, 1835.</p>
<p>The convention, as might have been supposed, was in practice
regarded by neither party, and was evaded when not actually set
at nought.&nbsp; It was said not to apply to any part of Spain
but the Basque provinces, nor to any troops enlisted after its
signature in April; but the massacre of prisoners was possibly
not so systematically carried out after the agreement as it had
been before.&nbsp; But, strangest of all, as soon as the news of
the signature of this convention became known at Madrid, the
utmost indignation was expressed, not only by the populace of
Madrid, but in the Cortes.&nbsp; An attempt was made to kill
Se&ntilde;or Martinez de la Rosa in the streets by an armed mob,
and the ministry was compelled to resign.&nbsp; Count Toreno was
then called to the supreme power on June 7, with Mendizabal as
finance minister.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the military skill of Zumalacarregui in the Basque
provinces, and of Cabrera in the east of Spain, had alone
prolonged the struggle during 1834 and 1835; but the death of
Zumalacarregui from a wound received in action near Bilbao in
June, 1835, was a serious blow to the hopes of the Pretender, <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>although there
are good grounds for supposing that the bold general&rsquo;s end
was hastened by poison administered by his own partisans. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>In the month of April of this same year, 1835, Lord
Palmerston, who, after a brief retirement from office in 1834,
was once more Foreign Secretary in London, had sanctioned the
enlisting of an army of ten thousand men in England, which, under
the command of Colonel, afterwards Sir de Lacy Evans, landed at
San Sebastian in August to assist the government of the regency
to put down the Carlists in the northwest.&nbsp; There was
already a British Auxiliary Contingent attached to the Spanish
army, and the British Naval Squadron, under Lord John Hay,
assisted the <i>Cristinos</i> on the coast between Bilbao and
Santander.</p>
<p>But neither the native nor the British supporters of the
regent were at this time successful in the Basque
provinces.&nbsp; Bilbao was for many months besieged, and was at
length relieved only in the month of December, 1836, by the
English forces co-operating with Espartero, who was created, for
his share in the victory, Count of Luchana.</p>
<p>The ministry of Count Toreno had lasted only from June to
September (1835), when Mendizabal assumed the chief direction of
affairs; and it was just two months later (November, 1835) that
George Borrow first set foot on the soil of the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Mendizabal continued to be Prime Minister until May, 1836,
when he was succeeded by a coalition ministry of Isturitz,
Galiano and the Duke of Rivas (see text, p. 181), under whose
administration took place <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the military riots at Madrid (August
11, 12), which were most bravely repressed by General Quesada,
the commandant of the city, as so graphically recorded by Borrow
(pp. 202&ndash;205).&nbsp; Yet Quesada&rsquo;s valour was of no
avail.&nbsp; The decree of La Granja, of August 13 and 14,
extorted from the fears of the queen regent by actual threats of
military violence, was followed by the precipitate flight of
Isturitz and Galiano to France, and of the Duke of Rivas to
Gibraltar, and the assumption of power by Se&ntilde;or Calatrava,
with Mendizabal as Minister of Finance.&nbsp; Quesada was
murdered, as is said and sung on p. 206 of the text.</p>
<p>If the <i>Cristino</i> cause had made but little progress in
1836, there was even less encouragement to be found in the result
of the military operations in the earlier part of 1837.&nbsp;
General Evans was defeated at Hernani, near San Sebastian, in
March, and although Lord John Hay with his English mariners took
Irun, Don Carlos was allowed to march almost unopposed upon the
capital.&nbsp; On September 12, he found himself within four
leagues of Madrid, and had it not been for his own poltroonery
and the jealousy and incompetence of those by whom he was
surrounded, he might have ridden into the Puerta del Sol on the
next day as King of Spain.&nbsp; But, <i>dis aliter visum</i> and
all undefeated, he turned his back upon La Corte, and marched
northwards with no apparent reason or policy, closely pressed by
the new commander-in-chief of the <i>Cristino</i> forces, a man
whose name is distinguished above that of any of his fellows in
the contemporary history of his country.</p>
<p>Baldomero Espartero, the son of a village wheelwright in La
Mancha, was born in 1792.&nbsp; Destined, like Cabrera, for the
priesthood, he took up arms on <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the French invasion in 1808, and at
the conclusion of the War of Independence in 1814 obtained a
military position in Peru, in which he had an opportunity of
distinguishing himself.&nbsp; After the capitulation of Ayacucho,
when the independence of Peru was finally recognized, Espartero
returned to Spain, and after some ten years of uneventful but
honoured service in the home army he found himself, in 1833,
entrusted with an important command in the queen&rsquo;s
army.&nbsp; Indolent and yet ambitious, dilatory and yet vigorous
when opportunity offered, loyal and yet politically
untrustworthy, Espartero flourished in the troublous times in
which he found himself, and made a name for himself both in camp
and court; and having, as we have seen, been created Count of
Luchana on the relief of Bilbao, he had taken the place of
Se&ntilde;or Calatrava as Prime Minister in August, 1837, and was
succeeded in the following October by Don Jos&eacute; Maria
Perez, who in turn gave place to Ofalia on November 30 (see text,
vol. ii. pp. 100, 121), when Espartero returned to Madrid as
Minister of War.</p>
<p>Cabrera meanwhile was ravaging Aragon and Valencia, and
continued not only absolutely to disregard the Eliot Convention,
and to massacre all the military prisoners that surrendered to
him, but to put to death the women and even the children that
fell into his hands.</p>
<p>But with the war in Aragon and Catalonia, the readers of
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Bible in Spain</i> have happily no need further
to concern themselves.</p>
<p>The British legion, which, after two years&rsquo; evil fortune
was at length becoming a force of some military value, was broken
up and sent back to London at the expense of the British
treasury, though a remnant elected to <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>remain in the Peninsula, which did
good service until the close of the year as the &ldquo;British
Auxiliary Brigade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1838 Espartero once more assumed the command
of the queen&rsquo;s army with the title of captain-general, and
gained an indecisive victory over the Carlists at
Pe&ntilde;acerrada, between Logro&ntilde;o and Vitoria, in June,
1838; while Cabrera was able to repulse the queen&rsquo;s forces
who sought to drive him from the strong position he had taken up
at Aragon.</p>
<p>The ministry resigned in August, and the Duke of Frias
presided over a short-lived cabinet, for in December, 1838, a new
ministry was formed under Se&ntilde;or Perez de Castro; and
Espartero, at length assuming the offensive with some vigour, was
enabled, by the treachery of the Carlist general Maroto, to march
unopposed into Ordu&ntilde;a, the ancient capital of Biscay, in
May, 1839.</p>
<p>After this practical victory Espartero was hailed as the
saviour of his country, and received the title of Duque de la
Victoria.&nbsp; Dissension soon completed what treachery had so
well begun.</p>
<p>Even among the strong partisan officials of Don Carlos there
were three parties, viz.&nbsp; <i>Marotistas</i>, men whose
professed object was to force Don Carlos to leave Spain, and to
bring about a marriage between his son and the young queen,
which, combined with a modified constitution, might pacify Spain;
secondly, a party headed by Villa Real and Marco del Pont, having
for its object the establishment of Don Carlos on the throne,
with powers limited by a permanent Cortes; and thirdly, the
bigoted Absolutist party, headed by Cabrera and Teijeiro.</p>
<p>In all these circumstances it was not surprising that the
abandonment of Ordu&ntilde;a in May should <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>have been
followed, after a good deal of intrigue and very little fighting,
by the Convention of Vergara on the last day of August.</p>
<p>Don Carlos immediately fled to France, and was housed by the
French government at Bourges, where he continued to hold his
court, and the war in North-Western Spain was at an end.</p>
<p>Cabrera, however, would have nothing to say to the Convention
of Vergara, and the spring of 1840 saw Espartero at the head of a
powerful force before the celebrated fortress of Morella, which
surrendered in May.</p>
<p>Cabrera was finally defeated by Espartero at Lerida in the
following July, and Spain at length enjoyed a desolate peace.</p>

13</span>NOTE.</h2>
<p>Before Mr. Burke had seen any part of this edition in print,
he was suddenly summoned to South America, as mentioned in his
note (i. 190), and accepted my suggestion that I should revise
and correct the proofs.&nbsp; His death shortly after leaving
England has deprived me of a valued friend, and the book of the
advantage of his final revision.&nbsp; While fully sensible of
the disadvantages which this must involve, I hope that the errors
thus caused will not prove so grave or so numerous as seriously
to detract from the value of the edition.&nbsp; My best thanks
are due to the many friends who have helped me, especially in the
preparation of the Glossary, which has considerably outgrown the
original draft.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 10, 1835, <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> I found myself off the coast of Galicia,
whose lofty mountains, gilded by the rising sun, presented a
magnificent appearance.&nbsp; I was bound for Lisbon; we passed
Cape Finisterre, and, standing farther out to sea, speedily lost
sight of land.&nbsp; On the morning of the 11th the sea was very
rough, and a remarkable circumstance occurred.&nbsp; I was on the
forecastle, discoursing with two of the sailors: one of them, who
had but just left his hammock, said, &ldquo;I have had a strange
dream, which I do not much like; for,&rdquo; continued he, <a
name="page1_2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>pointing up
to the mast, &ldquo;I dreamt that I fell into the sea from the
cross-trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was heard to say this by several of
the crew besides myself.&nbsp; A moment after the captain of the
vessel, perceiving that the squall was increasing, ordered the
topsails to be taken in, whereupon this man, with several others,
instantly ran aloft; the yard was in the act of being hauled
down, when a sudden gust of wind whirled it round with violence,
and a man was struck down from the cross-trees into the sea,
which was working like yeast below.&nbsp; In a short time he
emerged; I saw his head on the crest of a billow, and instantly
recognized in the unfortunate man the sailor who, a few moments
before, had related his dream.&nbsp; I shall never forget the
look of agony he cast whilst the steamer hurried past him.&nbsp;
The alarm was given, and everything was in confusion; it was two
minutes at least before the vessel was stopped, by which time the
man was a considerable way astern: I still, however, kept my eye
upon him, and could see that he was struggling gallantly with the
waves.&nbsp; A boat was at length lowered, but the rudder was
unfortunately not at hand, and only two oars could be procured,
with which the men could make but little progress in so rough a
sea.&nbsp; They did their best, however, and had arrived within
ten yards of the man, who still struggled for his life, when I
lost sight of him; and the men, on their return, said that they
saw him below the water, at glimpses, sinking deeper and deeper,
his arms stretched out and his body apparently stiff, but that
they found it impossible to save him.&nbsp; Presently after, the
sea, as if satisfied with the prey which it had acquired, became
comparatively calm.&nbsp; The poor fellow who perished in this
singular manner was a fine <a name="page1_3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>young man of twenty-seven, the only
son of a widowed mother; he was the best sailor on board, and was
beloved by all who were acquainted with him.&nbsp; This event
occurred on the 11th of November, 1835; the vessel was the
<i>London Merchant</i> steamship.&nbsp; Truly wonderful are the
ways of Providence!</p>
<p>That same night we entered the Tagus, and dropped anchor
before the old tower of Belem; <a name="citation3a"></a><a
href="#footnote3a" class="citation">[3a]</a> early the next
morning we weighed, and, proceeding onward about a league, we
again anchored at a short distance from the
<i>Caesodr&eacute;</i>, <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a> or principal quay of
Lisbon.&nbsp; Here we lay for some hours beside the enormous
black hulk of the <i>Rainha Nao</i>, a man-of-war which in old
times so captivated the eye of Nelson, that he would fain have
procured it for his native country.&nbsp; She was, long
subsequently, the admiral&rsquo;s ship of the Miguelite squadron,
and had been captured by the gallant Napier <a
name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c"
class="citation">[3c]</a> about three years previous to the time
of which I am speaking.</p>
<p>The <i>Rainha Nao</i> is said to have caused him more trouble
than all the other vessels of the enemy; and some assert that,
had the others defended themselves with half the fury which the
old vixen queen displayed, the result of the battle which decided
the fate of Portugal would have been widely different.</p>
<p>I found disembarkation at Lisbon to be a matter of
considerable vexation; the custom-house officers were exceedingly
uncivil, and examined every article of my little baggage with
most provoking minuteness.</p>
<p><a name="page1_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>My
first impression on landing in the Peninsula was by no means a
favourable one; and I had scarcely pressed the soil one hour
before I heartily wished myself back in Russia, a country which I
had quitted about one month previous, and where I had left
cherished friends and warm affections.</p>
<p>After having submitted to much ill usage and robbery at the
custom-house, I proceeded in quest of a lodging, and at last
found one, but dirty and expensive.&nbsp; The next day I hired a
servant, a Portuguese, it being my invariable custom, on arriving
in a country, to avail myself of the services of a native,
chiefly with the view of perfecting myself in the language; and,
being already acquainted with most of the principal languages and
dialects of the east and the west, I am soon able to make myself
quite intelligible to the inhabitants.&nbsp; In about a fortnight
I found myself conversing in Portuguese with considerable
fluency.</p>
<p>Those who wish to make themselves understood by a foreigner in
his own language should speak with much noise and vociferation,
opening their mouths wide.&nbsp; Is it surprising that the
English are, in general, the worst linguists in the world, seeing
that they pursue a system diametrically opposite?&nbsp; For
example, when they attempt to speak Spanish&mdash;the most
sonorous tongue in existence&mdash;they scarcely open their lips,
and, putting their hands in their pockets, fumble lazily, instead
of applying them to the indispensable office of
gesticulation.&nbsp; Well may the poor Spaniards exclaim,
<i>These English talk so crabbedly</i>, <i>that Satan himself
would not be able to understand them</i>.</p>
<p>Lisbon is a huge ruinous city, still exhibiting, in <a
name="page1_5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>almost every
direction, the vestiges of that terrific visitation of God, the
earthquake, which shattered it some eighty years ago.&nbsp; It
stands on seven hills, the loftiest of which is occupied by the
castle of Saint George, which is the boldest and most prominent
object to the eye, whilst surveying the city from the
Tagus.&nbsp; The most frequented and busy parts of the city are
those comprised within the valley to the north of this
elevation.</p>
<p>Here you find the Plaza of the Inquisition, the principal
square in Lisbon, <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> from which run parallel, towards the
river, three or four streets, amongst which are those of the gold
and silver, so designated from being inhabited by smiths cunning
in the working of those metals; they are, upon the whole, very
magnificent.&nbsp; The houses are huge, and as high as
castles.&nbsp; Immense pillars defend the causeway at intervals,
producing, however, rather a cumbrous effect.&nbsp; These streets
are quite level, and are well paved, in which respect they differ
from all the others in Lisbon.&nbsp; The most singular street,
however, of all is that of the <i>Alecrim</i>, or Rosemary, which
debouches on the <i>Caesodr&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; It is very
precipitous, and is occupied on either side by the palaces of the
principal Portuguese nobility, massive and frowning, but grand
and picturesque edifices, with here and there a hanging garden,
overlooking the street at a great height.</p>
<p>With all its ruin and desolation, Lisbon is <a
name="page1_6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>unquestionably the most remarkable city in the Peninsula,
and, perhaps, in the south of Europe.&nbsp; It is not my
intention to enter into minute details concerning it; I shall
content myself with remarking that it is quite as much deserving
the attention of the artist as even Rome itself.&nbsp; True it is
that, though it abounds with churches, it has no gigantic
cathedral, like St. Peter&rsquo;s, to attract the eye and fill it
with wonder, yet I boldly say that there is no monument of
man&rsquo;s labour and skill, pertaining either to ancient or
modern Rome, for whatever purpose designed, which can rival the
water-works of Lisbon; I mean the stupendous aqueduct whose
principal arches cross the valley to the north-east of Lisbon,
and which discharges its little runnel of cool and delicious
water into the rocky cistern within that beautiful edifice called
the Mother of the Waters, from whence all Lisbon is supplied with
the crystal lymph, though the source is seven leagues
distant.&nbsp; Let travellers devote one entire morning to
inspecting the <i>Arcos</i> and the <i>Mai das agoas</i>, after
which they may repair to the English church and cemetery,
P&egrave;re-la-Chaise in miniature, where, if they be of England,
they may well be excused if they kiss the cold tomb, as I did, of
the author of &ldquo;Amelia,&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> the most singular
genius which their island ever produced, whose works it has long
been the fashion to abuse in public and to read in secret.&nbsp;
In the same cemetery rest the mortal remains of Doddridge,
another English author of a different stamp, but justly admired
and esteemed. <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; I had not intended, on
disembarking, to remain long in Lisbon, nor <a
name="page1_7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>indeed in
Portugal; my destination was Spain, whither I shortly proposed to
direct my steps, it being the intention of the Bible Society to
attempt to commence operations in that country, the object of
which should be the distribution of the word of God, for Spain
had hitherto been a region barred against the admission of the
Bible; not so Portugal, where, since the revolution, the Bible
had been permitted both to be introduced and circulated.&nbsp;
Little, however, had been accomplished; therefore, finding myself
in the country, I determined, if possible, to effect something in
the way of distribution, but first of all to make myself
acquainted as to how far the people were disposed to receive the
Bible, and whether the state of education in general would permit
them to turn it to much account.&nbsp; I had plenty of Bibles and
Testaments at my disposal, but could the people read them, or
would they?&nbsp; A friend of the Society to whom I was
recommended was absent from Lisbon at the period of my arrival;
this I regretted, as he could have afforded me several useful
hints.&nbsp; In order, however, that no time might be lost, I
determined not to wait for his arrival, but at once proceed to
gather the best information I could upon those points to which I
have already alluded.&nbsp; I determined to commence my
researches at some slight distance from Lisbon, being well aware
of the erroneous ideas that I must form of the Portuguese in
general, should I judge of their character and opinions from what
I saw and heard in a city so much subjected to foreign
intercourse.</p>
<p>My first excursion was to Cintra. <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; If there be
any <a name="page1_8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>place
in the world entitled to the appellation of an enchanted region,
it is surely Cintra; Tivoli <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> is a beautiful and
picturesque place, but it quickly fades from the mind of those
who have seen the Portuguese Paradise.&nbsp; When speaking of
Cintra, it must not for a moment be supposed that nothing more is
meant than the little town or city; by Cintra must be understood
the entire region, town, palace, <i>quintas</i>, forests, crags,
Moorish ruin, which suddenly burst on the view on rounding the
side of a bleak, savage, and sterile-looking mountain.&nbsp;
Nothing is more sullen and uninviting than the south-western
aspect of the stony wall which, on the side of Lisbon, seems to
shield Cintra from the eye of the world, but the other side is a
mingled scene of fairy beauty, artificial elegance, savage
grandeur, domes, turrets, enormous trees, flowers, and
waterfalls, such as is met with nowhere else beneath the
sun.&nbsp; Oh! there are strange and wonderful objects at Cintra,
and strange and wonderful recollections attached to them.&nbsp;
The ruin on that lofty peak, and which covers part of the side of
that precipitous steep, was once the principal stronghold of the
Lusitanian Moors, and thither, long after they had disappeared,
at a particular moon of every year, were wont to repair wild
<i>santons</i> of Maugrabie, to pray at the tomb of a famous
<i>Sidi</i>, who slumbers amongst the rocks.&nbsp; That grey
palace witnessed the assemblage of the last Cortes held by the
boy-king Sebastian, <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a> ere he departed on
his <a name="page1_9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>romantic expedition against the Moors, who so well
avenged their insulted faith and country at Alcazar-quibir; <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> and in that low shady <i>quinta</i>,
embowered amongst those tall <i>alcornoques</i>, once dwelt John
de Castro, <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> the strange old viceroy of Goa, who
pawned the hairs of his dead son&rsquo;s beard to raise money to
repair the ruined wall of a fortress threatened by the heathen of
Ind; those crumbling stones which stand before the portal, deeply
graven, not with &ldquo;runes,&rdquo; but things equally dark,
Sanscrit rhymes from the Vedas, were brought by him from Goa, the
most brilliant scene of his glory, before Portugal had become a
base kingdom; and down that dingle, on an abrupt rocky
promontory, stand the ruined halls of the English millionaire, <a
name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a> who there nursed the wayward fancies of
a mind as wild, rich, and variegated as the scenes around.&nbsp;
Yes, wonderful are the objects which meet the eye at Cintra, and
wonderful are the recollections attached to them.</p>
<p>The town of Cintra contains about eight hundred
inhabitants.&nbsp; The morning subsequent to my arrival, <a
name="page1_10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>as I was
about to ascend the mountain for the purpose of examining the
Moorish ruins, I observed a person advancing towards me whom I
judged by his dress to be an ecclesiastic; he was in fact one of
the three priests of the place.&nbsp; I instantly accosted him,
and had no reason to regret doing so; I found him affable and
communicative.</p>
<p>After praising the beauty of the surrounding scenery, I made
some inquiry as to the state of education amongst the people
under his care.&nbsp; He answered that he was sorry to say that
they were in a state of great ignorance, very few of the common
people being able either to read or write; that with respect to
schools, there was but one in the place, where four or five
children were taught the alphabet, but that even this was at
present closed.&nbsp; He informed me, however, that there was a
school at Colhares, about a league distant.&nbsp; Amongst other
things, he said that nothing more surprised him than to see
Englishmen, the most learned and intelligent people in the world,
visiting a place like Cintra, where there was no literature,
science, nor anything of utility (<i>coisa que presta</i>).&nbsp;
I suspect that there was some covert satire in the last speech of
the worthy priest; I was, however, Jesuit enough to appear to
receive it as a high compliment, and, taking off my hat, departed
with an infinity of bows.</p>
<p>That same day I visited Colhares, a romantic village on the
side of the mountain of Cintra, to the northwest.&nbsp; Seeing
some peasants collected round a smithy, I inquired about the
school, whereupon one of the men instantly conducted me
thither.&nbsp; I went upstairs into a small apartment, where I
found the master with about a dozen pupils standing in a row; I
saw <a name="page1_11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>but
one stool in the room, and to that, after having embraced me, he
conducted me with great civility.&nbsp; After some discourse, he
showed me the books which he used for the instruction of the
children; they were spelling-books, much of the same kind as
those used in the village schools in England.&nbsp; Upon my
asking him whether it was his practice to place the Scriptures in
the hands of the children, he informed me that long before they
had acquired sufficient intelligence to understand them they were
removed by their parents, in order that they might assist in the
labours of the field, and that the parents in general were by no
means solicitous that their children should learn anything, as
they considered the time occupied in learning as so much
squandered away.&nbsp; He said that, though the schools were
nominally supported by the government, it was rarely that the
schoolmasters could obtain their salaries, on which account many
had of late resigned their employments.&nbsp; He told me that he
had a copy of the New Testament in his possession, which I
desired to see; but on examining it I discovered that it was only
the Epistles by Pereira, <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a> with copious
notes.&nbsp; I asked him whether he considered that there was
harm in reading the Scriptures without notes: he replied that
there was certainly no harm in it, but that simple people,
without the help of notes, could derive but little benefit from
Scripture, as the greatest part would be unintelligible to them;
<a name="page1_12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>whereupon I shook hands with him, and, on departing,
said that there was no part of Scripture so difficult to
understand as those very notes which were intended to elucidate
it, and that it would never have been written if not calculated
of itself to illume the minds of all classes of mankind.</p>
<p>In a day or two I made an excursion to Mafra, distant about
three leagues from Cintra.&nbsp; The principal part of the way
lay over steep hills, somewhat dangerous for horses; however, I
reached the place in safety.</p>
<p>Mafra <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> is a large village in the neighbourhood
of an immense building, intended to serve as a convent and
palace, and which is built somewhat after the fashion of the
Escurial.&nbsp; In this edifice exists the finest library in
Portugal, containing books on all sciences and in all languages,
and well suited to the size and grandeur of the edifice which
contains it.&nbsp; There were no monks, however, to take care of
it, as in former times; they had been driven forth, some to beg
their bread, some to serve under the banners of Don Carlos, in
Spain, and many, as I was informed, to prowl about as
banditti.&nbsp; I found the place abandoned to two or three
menials, and exhibiting an aspect of solitude and desolation
truly appalling.&nbsp; Whilst I was viewing the cloisters, a fine
intelligent-looking lad came up and asked (I suppose in the hope
of obtaining a trifle) whether I would permit him to show me the
village church, which he informed me was well worth seeing; I
said no, but added, that if he would show me the village school
<a name="page1_13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I should
feel much obliged to him.&nbsp; He looked at me with
astonishment, and assured me that there was nothing to be seen at
the school, which did not contain more than half a dozen boys,
and that he himself was one of the number.&nbsp; On my telling
him, however, that he should show me no other place, he at length
unwillingly attended me.&nbsp; On the way I learned from him that
the schoolmaster was one of the friars who had lately been
expelled from the convent, that he was a very learned man, and
spoke French and Greek.&nbsp; We passed a stone cross, and the
boy bent his head and crossed himself with much devotion.&nbsp; I
mention this circumstance, as it was the first instance of the
kind which I had observed amongst the Portuguese since my
arrival.&nbsp; When near the house where the schoolmaster
resided, he pointed it out to me, and then hid himself behind a
wall, where he awaited my return.</p>
<p>On stepping over the threshold I was confronted by a short,
stout man, between sixty and seventy years of age, dressed in a
blue jerkin and grey trousers, without shirt or waistcoat.&nbsp;
He looked at me sternly, and inquired in the French language what
was my pleasure.&nbsp; I apologized for intruding upon him, and
stated that, being informed he occupied the situation of
schoolmaster, I had come to pay my respects to him and to beg
permission to ask a few questions respecting the seminary.&nbsp;
He answered, that whoever told me he was a schoolmaster lied, for
that he was a friar of the convent, and nothing else.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not, then, true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that all the
convents have been broken up and the monks
dismissed?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he with a
sigh, &ldquo;it is true; it is but too true.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
was silent for a minute, and, his better <a
name="page1_14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>nature
overcoming his angry feelings, he produced a snuff-box and
offered it to me.&nbsp; The snuff-box is the olive-branch of the
Portuguese, and he who wishes to be on good terms with them must
never refuse to dip his finger and thumb into it when
offered.&nbsp; I took, therefore, a huge pinch, though I detest
the dust, and we were soon on the best possible terms.&nbsp; He
was eager to obtain news, especially from Lisbon and Spain.&nbsp;
I told him that the officers of the troops at Lisbon had, the day
before I left that place, gone in a body to the queen, and
insisted upon her either receiving their swords or dismissing her
Ministers; whereupon he rubbed his hands, and said that he was
sure matters would not remain tranquil at Lisbon.&nbsp; On my
saying, however, that I thought the affairs of Don Carlos were on
the decline (this was shortly after the death of Zumalacarregui),
<a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> he frowned, and cried that it could
not possibly be, for that God was too just to suffer it.&nbsp; I
felt for the poor man who had been driven out of his home in the
noble convent close by, and from a state of affluence and comfort
reduced in his old age to indigence and misery, for his present
dwelling scarcely seemed to contain an article of
furniture.&nbsp; I tried twice or thrice to induce him to
converse about the school, but he either avoided the subject or
said shortly that he knew nothing about it.&nbsp; On my leaving
him, the boy came from his hiding-place and rejoined me; he said
that he had hidden himself through fear of his master&rsquo;s
knowing that he had brought me to him, for that he was unwilling
that any stranger should know that he was a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>I asked the boy whether he or his parents were <a
name="page1_15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>acquainted
with the Scripture, and ever read it; he did not, however, seem
to understand me.&nbsp; I must here observe that the boy was
fifteen years of age, that he was in many respects very
intelligent, and had some knowledge of the Latin language;
nevertheless he knew not the Scripture even by name, and I have
no doubt, from what I subsequently observed, that at least
two-thirds of his countrymen are on that important point no wiser
than himself.&nbsp; At the doors of village inns, at the hearths
of the rustics, in the fields where they labour, at the stone
fountains by the wayside where they water their cattle, I have
questioned the lower class of the children of Portugal about the
Scripture, the Bible, the Old and New Testament, and in no one
instance have they known what I was alluding to, or could return
me a rational answer, though on all other matters their replies
were sensible enough; indeed, nothing surprised me more than the
free and unembarrassed manner in which the Portuguese peasantry
sustain a conversation, and the purity of the language in which
they express their thoughts, and yet few of them can read or
write; whereas the peasantry of England, whose education is in
general much superior, are in their conversation coarse and dull
almost to brutality, and absurdly ungrammatical in their
language, though the English tongue is upon the whole more simple
in its structure than the Portuguese.</p>
<p>On my return to Lisbon I found our friend ---, who received me
very kindly.&nbsp; The next ten days were exceedingly rainy,
which prevented me from making any excursions into the country:
during this time I saw our friend frequently, and had long
conversations with him concerning the best means <a
name="page1_16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of
distributing the Gospel.&nbsp; He thought we could do no better
for the present than put part of our stock into the hands of the
booksellers of Lisbon, and at the same time employ colporteurs to
hawk the books about the streets, receiving a certain profit on
every copy they sold.&nbsp; This plan was agreed upon, and
forthwith put in practice, and with some success.&nbsp; I had
thoughts of sending colporteurs into the neighbouring villages,
but to this our friend objected.&nbsp; He thought the attempt
dangerous, as it was very possible that the rural priesthood, who
still possessed much influence in their own districts, and who
were for the most part decided enemies to the spread of the
Gospel, might cause the men employed to be assassinated or
ill-treated.</p>
<p>I determined, however, ere leaving Portugal, to establish
dep&ocirc;ts of Bibles in one or two of the provincial
towns.&nbsp; I wished to visit the Alemtejo, which I had heard
was a very benighted region.&nbsp; The Alemtejo <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a> means the province beyond the
Tagus.&nbsp; This province is not beautiful and picturesque, like
most other parts of Portugal; there are few hills and
mountains.&nbsp; The greater part consists of heaths broken by
knolls, and gloomy dingles, and forests of stunted pine; these
places are infested with banditti.&nbsp; The principal city is
Evora, one of the most ancient in Portugal, and formerly the seat
of a branch of the Inquisition yet more cruel and baneful than
the terrible one of Lisbon.&nbsp; Evora lies about sixty miles
from Lisbon, and to Evora I determined on going with twenty
Testaments and two Bibles.&nbsp; How I fared there will presently
be seen.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 6th of December I set out for Evora,
accompanied by my servant.&nbsp; I had been informed that the
tide would serve for the regular passage-boats, or felouks, as
they are called, at about four o&rsquo;clock; but on reaching the
side of the Tagus opposite to Aldea Gallega, between which place
and Lisbon the boats ply, I found that the tide would not permit
them to start before eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Had I waited for
them I should have probably landed at Aldea Gallega about
midnight, and I felt little inclination to make my
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> in the Alemtejo at that hour; therefore, as
I saw small boats which can push off at any time lying near in
abundance, I determined upon hiring one of them for the passage,
though the expense would be thus considerably increased.&nbsp; I
soon agreed with a wild-looking lad, who told me that he was in
part owner of one of the boats, to take me over.&nbsp; I was not
aware of the <a name="page1_18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>danger in crossing the Tagus at its broadest part, which
is opposite Aldea Gallega, at any time, but especially at close
of day in the winter season, or I should certainly not have
ventured.&nbsp; The lad and his comrade, a miserable-looking
object, whose only clothing, notwithstanding the season, was a
tattered jerkin and trousers, rowed until we had advanced about
half a mile from the land; they then set up a large sail, and the
lad, who seemed to direct everything, and to be the principal,
took the helm and steered.&nbsp; The evening was now setting in;
the sun was not far from its bourne in the horizon; the air was
very cold, the wind was rising, and the waves of the noble Tagus
began to be crested with foam.&nbsp; I told the boy that it was
scarcely possible for the boat to carry so much sail without
upsetting, upon which he laughed, and began to gabble in a most
incoherent manner.&nbsp; He had the most harsh and rapid
articulation that has ever come under my observation in any human
being; it was the scream of the hyena blended with the bark of
the terrier, though it was by no means an index of his
disposition, which I soon found to be light, merry, and anything
but malevolent; for when I, in order to show him that I cared
little about him, began to hum &ldquo;<i>Eu que sou
contrabandista</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a> he laughed heartily,
and said, clapping me on the shoulder, that he would not drown us
if he could help it.&nbsp; The other poor fellow seemed by no
means averse to go to the bottom: he sat at the fore part of the
boat, looking the image of famine, and only smiled when the
waters broke over the weather side and soaked his scanty
habiliments.&nbsp; In <a name="page1_19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>a little time I had made up my mind
that our last hour was come; the wind was getting higher, the
short dangerous waves were more foamy, the boat was frequently on
its beam, and the water came over the lee side in torrents.&nbsp;
But still the wild lad at the helm held on, laughing and
chattering, and occasionally yelling out part of the Miguelite
air, &ldquo;<i>Quando el Rey chegou</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> the singing of which in Lisbon is
imprisonment.</p>
<p>The stream was against us, but the wind was in our favour, and
we sprang along at a wonderful rate, and I saw that our only
chance of escape was in speedily passing the farther bank of the
Tagus, where the bight or bay at the extremity of which stands
Aldea Gallega commences, for we should not then have to battle
with the waves of the stream, which the adverse wind lashed into
fury.&nbsp; It was the will of the Almighty to permit us speedily
to gain this shelter, but not before the boat was nearly filled
with water, and we were all wet to the skin.&nbsp; At about seven
o&rsquo;clock in the evening we reached Aldea Gallega, shivering
with cold and in a most deplorable plight.</p>
<p>Aldea Gallega, or the Galician Village (for the two words are
Spanish, and have that signification), is a place containing, I
should think, about four thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; It was
pitchy dark when we landed, but rockets soon began to fly about
in all directions, illuming the air far and wide.&nbsp; As we
passed along the dirty unpaved street which leads to the
<i>largo</i>, or square, in which the inn is situated, a horrible
uproar of drums and voices assailed our ears.&nbsp; On inquiring
the cause of all this bustle, I was informed that it was the eve
of the Conception of the Virgin.</p>
<p><a name="page1_20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>As it
was not the custom of the people at the inn to furnish provisions
for the guests, I wandered about in search of food; and at last,
seeing some soldiers eating and drinking in a species of
wine-house, I went in and asked the people to let me have some
supper, and in a short time they furnished me with a tolerable
meal, for which, however, they charged three crowns.</p>
<p>Having engaged with a person for mules to carry us to Evora,
which were to be ready at five next morning, I soon retired to
bed, my servant sleeping in the same apartment, which was the
only one in the house vacant.&nbsp; I closed not my eyes during
the whole night.&nbsp; Beneath us was a stable, in which some
<i>almocreves</i>, or carriers, slept with their mules; at our
back, in the yard, was a pigsty.&nbsp; How could I sleep?&nbsp;
The hogs grunted, the mules screamed, and the <i>almocreves</i>
snored most horribly.&nbsp; I heard the village clock strike the
hours until midnight, and from midnight till four in the morning,
when I sprang up and began to dress, and despatched my servant to
hasten the man with the mules, for I was heartily tired of the
place and wanted to leave it.&nbsp; An old man, bony and hale,
accompanied by a bare-footed lad, brought the beasts, which were
tolerably good.&nbsp; He was the proprietor of them, and
intended, with the lad, who was his nephew, to accompany us to
Evora.</p>
<p>When we started the moon was shining brightly, and the morning
was piercingly cold.&nbsp; We soon entered on a sandy hollow way,
emerging from which we passed by a strange-looking and large
edifice, standing on a high bleak sandhill on our left.&nbsp; We
were speedily overtaken by five or six men on horseback, riding
at a rapid pace, each with a long gun slung at his saddle, the
muzzle depending about two feet below the horse&rsquo;s <a
name="page1_21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>belly.&nbsp; I inquired of the old man what was the
reason of this warlike array.&nbsp; He answered, that the roads
were very bad (meaning that they abounded with robbers), and that
they went armed in this manner for their defence; they soon
turned off to the right towards Palmella.</p>
<p>We reached a sandy plain studded with stunted pine; the road
was little more than a footpath, and as we proceeded the trees
thickened and became a wood, which extended for two leagues, with
clear spaces at intervals, in which herds of cattle and sheep
were feeding; the bells attached to their necks were ringing
lowly and monotonously.&nbsp; The sun was just beginning to show
itself; but the morning was misty and dreary, which, together
with the aspect of desolation which the country exhibited, had an
unfavourable effect on my spirits.&nbsp; I got down and walked,
entering into conversation with the old man.&nbsp; He seemed to
have but one theme, &ldquo;the robbers,&rdquo; and the atrocities
they were in the habit of practising in the very spots we were
passing.&nbsp; The tales he told were truly horrible, and to
avoid them I mounted again, and rode on considerably in
front.</p>
<p>In about an hour and a half we emerged from the forest, and
entered upon a savage, wild, broken ground, covered with
<i>mato</i>, or brushwood.&nbsp; The mules stopped to drink at a
shallow pool, and on looking to the right I saw a ruined
wall.&nbsp; This, the guide informed me, was the remains of
Vendas Velhas, or the Old Inn, formerly the haunt of the
celebrated robber Sabocha.&nbsp; This Sabocha, it seems, had,
some sixteen years ago, a band of about forty ruffians at his
command, who infested these wilds, and supported themselves by
plunder.&nbsp; For a considerable time Sabocha pursued <a
name="page1_22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>his
atrocious trade unsuspected, and many an unfortunate traveller
was murdered in the dead of night at the solitary inn by the
woodside which he kept; indeed, a more fit situation for plunder
and murder I never saw.&nbsp; The gang were in the habit of
watering their horses at the pool, and perhaps of washing therein
their hands stained with the blood of their victims.&nbsp; The
lieutenant of the troop was the brother of Sabocha, a fellow of
great strength and ferocity, particularly famous for the skill he
possessed in darting a long knife, with which he was in the habit
of transfixing his opponents.&nbsp; Sabocha&rsquo;s connexion
with the gang at length became known, and he fled, with the
greater part of his associates, across the Tagus to the northern
provinces.&nbsp; Himself and his brothers eventually lost their
lives on the road to Coimbra, in an engagement with the
military.&nbsp; His house was razed by order of the
government.</p>
<p>The ruins are still frequently visited by banditti, who eat
and drink amidst them, and look out for prey, as the place
commands a view of the road.&nbsp; The old man assured me, that
about two months previous, on returning to Aldea Gallega with his
mules from accompanying some travellers, he had been knocked
down, stripped naked, and all his money taken from him, by a
fellow who he believed came from this murderers&rsquo;
nest.&nbsp; He said that he was an exceedingly powerful young
man, with immense moustaches and whiskers, and was armed with an
<i>espingarda</i>, or musket.&nbsp; About ten days subsequently
he saw the robber at Vendas Novas, where we should pass the
night.&nbsp; The fellow on recognizing him took him aside, and,
with horrid imprecations, threatened that he should never be
permitted to return home <a name="page1_23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>if he attempted to discover him; he
therefore held his peace, as there was little to be gained and
everything to be risked in apprehending him, as he would have
been speedily set at liberty for want of evidence to criminate
him, and then he would not have failed to have had his revenge,
or would have been anticipated therein by his comrades.</p>
<p>I dismounted and went up to the place, and saw the vestiges of
a fire and a broken bottle.&nbsp; The sons of plunder had been
there very lately.&nbsp; I left a New Testament and some tracts
amongst the ruins, and hastened away.</p>
<p>The sun had dispelled the mists and was beaming very
hot.&nbsp; We rode on for about an hour, when I heard the
neighing of a horse in our rear, and our guide said there was a
party of horsemen behind; our mules were good, and they did not
overtake us for at least twenty minutes.&nbsp; The headmost rider
was a gentleman in a fashionable travelling dress; a little way
behind were an officer, two soldiers, and a boy in livery.&nbsp;
I heard the principal horseman, on overtaking my servant,
inquiring who I was, and whether French or English.&nbsp; He was
told I was an English gentleman, travelling.&nbsp; He then asked
whether I understood Portuguese; the man said I understood it,
but he believed that I spoke French and Italian better.&nbsp; The
gentleman then spurred on his horse, and accosted me, not in
Portuguese, nor in French or Italian, but in the purest English
that I ever heard spoken by a foreigner; it had, indeed, nothing
of foreign accent or pronunciation in it; and had I not known, by
the countenance of the speaker, that he was no Englishman (for
there is a peculiarity in the countenance, as everybody knows,
which, though it cannot be described, <a
name="page1_24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>is sure to
betray the Englishman), I should have concluded that I was in
company with a countryman.&nbsp; We continued discoursing until
we arrived at Peg&otilde;es.</p>
<p>Peg&otilde;es consists of about two or three houses and an
inn; there is likewise a species of barrack, where half a dozen
soldiers are stationed.&nbsp; In the whole of Portugal there is
no place of worse reputation, and the inn is nicknamed
<i>Estalagem de Ladr&otilde;es</i>, or the hostelry of thieves;
for it is there that the banditti of the wilderness, which
extends around it on every side for leagues, are in the habit of
coming and spending the money, the fruits of their criminal
daring; there they dance and sing, eat fricasseed rabbits and
olives, and drink the muddy but strong wine of the
Alemtejo.&nbsp; An enormous fire, fed by the trunk of a
cork-tree, was blazing in a niche on the left hand on entering
the spacious kitchen.&nbsp; Close by it, seething, were several
large jars, which emitted no disagreeable odour, and reminded me
that I had not broken my fast, although it was now nearly one
o&rsquo;clock, and I had ridden five leagues.&nbsp; Several
wild-looking men, who, if they were not banditti, might easily be
mistaken for such, were seated on logs about the fire.&nbsp; I
asked them some unimportant questions, to which they replied with
readiness and civility, and one of them, who said he could read,
accepted a tract which I offered him.</p>
<p>My new friend, who had been bespeaking dinner, or rather
breakfast, now, with great civility, invited me to partake of it,
and at the same time introduced me to the officer who accompanied
him, and who was his brother, and also spoke English, though not
so well as himself.&nbsp; I found I had become acquainted <a
name="page1_25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>with Don <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a> Geronimo Joz&eacute; d&rsquo;Azveto,
secretary to the government at Evora; his brother belonged to a
regiment of hussars, whose head-quarters were at Evora, but which
had outlying parties along the road,&mdash;for example, the place
where we were stopping.</p>
<p>

</a>Rabbits at Peg&otilde;es <a name="citation25b"></a><a
href="#footnote25b" class="citation">[25b]</a> seem to be a
standard article of food, being produced in abundance on the
moors around.&nbsp; We had one fried, the gravy of which was
delicious, and afterwards a roasted one, which was brought up on
a dish entire; the hostess, having first washed her hands,
proceeded to tear the animal to pieces, which having
accomplished, she poured over the fragments a sweet sauce.&nbsp;
I ate heartily of both dishes, particularly of the last; owing,
perhaps, to the novel and curious manner in which it was served
up.&nbsp; Excellent figs, from the Algarves, and apples,
concluded our repast, which we ate in a little side room with a
mud floor, which sent such a piercing chill into my system, as
prevented me from deriving that pleasure from my fare and my
agreeable companions that I should have otherwise
experienced.</p>
<p>Don Geronimo had been educated in England, <a
name="page1_26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>in which
country he passed his boyhood, which in a certain degree
accounted for his proficiency in the English language, the idiom
and pronunciation of which can only be acquired by residing in
the country at that period of one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; He had also
fled thither shortly after the usurpation of the throne of
Portugal by Don Miguel, and from thence had departed to the
Brazils, where he had devoted himself to the service of Don
Pedro, and had followed him in the expedition which terminated in
the downfall of the usurper, and the establishment of the
constitutional government in Portugal.&nbsp; Our conversation
rolled chiefly on literary and political subjects, and my
acquaintance with the writings of the most celebrated authors of
Portugal was hailed with surprise and delight; for nothing is
more gratifying to a Portuguese than to observe a foreigner
taking an interest in the literature of his nation, of which, in
many respects, he is justly proud.</p>
<p>At about two o&rsquo;clock we were once more in the saddle,
and pursued our way in company, through a country exactly
resembling that which we had previously been traversing, rugged
and broken, with here and there a clump of pines.&nbsp; The
afternoon was exceedingly fine, and the bright rays of the sun
relieved the desolation of the scene.&nbsp; Having advanced about
two leagues, we caught sight of a large edifice towering
majestically in the distance, which I learnt was a royal palace
standing at the farther extremity of Vendas Novas, the village in
which we were to pass the night; it was considerably more than a
league from us, yet, seen through the clear transparent
atmosphere of Portugal, it appeared much nearer.</p>
<p>Before reaching it we passed by a stone cross, <a
name="page1_27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>on the
pedestal of which was an inscription commemorating a horrible
murder of a native of Lisbon, which had occurred on that spot; it
looked ancient, and was covered with moss, and the greater part
of the inscription was illegible&mdash;at least it was to me, who
could not bestow much time on its deciphering.&nbsp; Having
arrived at Vendas Novas, and bespoken supper, my new friend and
myself strolled forth to view the palace.&nbsp; It was built by
the late king of Portugal, and presents little that is remarkable
in its exterior; it is a long edifice with wings, and is only two
stories high, though it can be seen afar off, from being situated
on elevated ground; it has fifteen windows in the upper, and
twelve in the lower story, with a paltry-looking door, something
like that of a barn, to which you ascend by one single
step.&nbsp; The interior corresponds with the exterior, offering
nothing which can gratify curiosity, if we except the kitchens,
which are indeed magnificent, and so large that food enough might
be cooked in them, at one time, to serve as a repast for all the
inhabitants of the Alemtejo.</p>
<p>I passed the night with great comfort in a clean bed, remote
from all those noises so rife in a Portuguese inn, and the next
morning at six we again set out on our journey, which we hoped to
terminate before sunset, as Evora is but ten leagues from Vendas
Novas.&nbsp; The preceding morning had been cold, but the present
one was far colder&mdash;so much so, that just before sunrise I
could no longer support it on horseback, and therefore,
dismounting, ran and walked until we reached a few houses at the
termination of these desolate moors.&nbsp; It was in one of these
houses that the commissioners of Don Pedro and <a
name="page1_28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Miguel met,
<a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> and it was there agreed that the latter
should resign the crown in favour of Dona Maria, for Evora was
the last stronghold of the usurper, and the moors of the Alemtejo
the last area of the combats which so long agitated unhappy
Portugal.&nbsp; I therefore gazed on the miserable huts with
considerable interest, and did not fail to scatter in the
neighbourhood several of the precious little tracts with which,
together with a small quantity of Testaments, my carpet-bag was
provided.</p>
<p>The country began to improve; the savage heaths were left
behind, and we saw hills and dales, cork-trees, and
<i>azinheiras</i>, on the last of which trees grows that kind of
sweet acorn called <i>bolotas</i>, which is pleasant as a
chestnut, and which supplies in winter the principal food on
which the numerous swine of the Alemtejo subsist.&nbsp; Gallant
swine they are, with short legs and portly bodies of a black or
dark red colour; and for the excellence of their flesh I can
vouch, having frequently luxuriated upon it in the course of my
wanderings in this province; the <i>lombo</i>, or loin, when
broiled on the live embers, is delicious, especially when eaten
with olives.</p>
<p>We were now in sight of Monte Moro, which, as the name
denotes, was once a fortress of the Moors.&nbsp; It is a high
steep hill, on the summit and sides of which are ruined walls and
towers.&nbsp; At its western side is a deep ravine or valley,
through which a small stream rushes, traversed by a stone bridge;
farther down there is a ford, over which we passed and ascended
to the town, which, commencing near the northern base, passes
over the lower ridge towards the north-east.&nbsp; The town is
exceedingly picturesque, and <a name="page1_29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>many of the houses are very ancient,
and built in the Moorish fashion.&nbsp; I wished much to examine
the relics of Moorish sway on the upper part of the mountain, but
time pressed, and the short period of our stay at this place did
not permit me to gratify my inclination.</p>
<p>Monte Moro is the head of a range of hills which cross this
part of the Alemtejo, and from hence they fork east and
south-east, towards the former of which directions lies the
direct road to Elvas, Badajoz, and Madrid; and towards the latter
that to Evora.&nbsp; A beautiful mountain, covered to the top
with cork-trees, is the third of the chain which skirts the way
in the direction of Elvas.&nbsp; It is called Monte Almo; a brook
brawls at its base, and as I passed it the sun was shining
gloriously on the green herbage, on which flocks of goats were
feeding, with their bells ringing merrily, so that the <i>tout
ensemble</i> resembled a fairy scene; and that nothing might be
wanted to complete the picture, I here met a man, a goatherd,
beneath an <i>azinheira</i>, whose appearance recalled to my mind
the Brute Carle, mentioned in the Danish ballad of Swayne
Vonved:&mdash;<a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A wild swine on his shoulders he kept,<br
/>
And upon his bosom a black bear slept;<br />
And about his fingers, with hair o&rsquo;erhung,<br />
The squirrel sported, and weasel clung.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page1_30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Upon
the shoulder of the goatherd was a beast, which he told me was a
<i>lontra</i>, or otter, which he had lately caught in the
neighbouring brook; it had a string round its neck, which was
attached to his arm.&nbsp; At his left side was a bag, from the
top of which peered the heads of two or three singular-looking
animals; and at his right was squatted the sullen cub of a wolf,
which he was endeavouring to tame.&nbsp; His whole appearance was
to the last degree savage and wild.&nbsp; After a little
conversation, such as those who meet on the road frequently hold,
I asked him if he could read, but he made me no answer.&nbsp; I
then inquired if he knew anything of God or Jesus Christ; he
looked me fixedly in the face for a moment, and then turned his
countenance towards the sun, which was beginning to sink in the
west, nodded to it, and then again looked fixedly upon me.&nbsp;
I believe that I understood the mute reply, which probably was,
that it was God who made that glorious light which illumes and
gladdens all creation; and, gratified with that belief, I left
him and hastened after my companions, who were by this time a
considerable way in advance.</p>
<p>I have always found in the disposition of the children of the
fields a more determined tendency to religion and piety than
amongst the inhabitants of towns and cities, and the reason is
obvious&mdash;they are less acquainted with the works of
man&rsquo;s hands than with those of God; their occupations, too,
which are simple, and requiring less of ingenuity and skill <a
name="page1_31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>than those
which engage the attention of the other portion of their
fellow-creatures, are less favourable to the engendering of
self-conceit and self-sufficiency, so utterly at variance with
that lowliness of spirit which constitutes the best foundation of
piety.&nbsp; The sneerers and scoffers at religion do not spring
from amongst the simple children of nature, but are the
excrescences of over-wrought refinement; and though their baneful
influence has indeed penetrated to the country and corrupted man
there, the source and fountain-head was amongst crowded houses,
where nature is scarcely known.&nbsp; I am not one of those who
look for perfection amongst the rural population of any
country&mdash;perfection is not to be found amongst the children
of the fall, wherever their abodes may happen to be; but, until
the heart discredits the existence of a God, there is still hope
for the soul of the possessor, however stained with crime he may
be, for even Simon the magician was converted.&nbsp; But when the
heart is once steeled with infidelity, infidelity confirmed by
carnal wisdom, an exuberance of the grace of God is required to
melt it, which is seldom manifested; for we read in the blessed
book that the Pharisee and the wizard became receptacles of
grace, but where is there mention made of the conversion of the
sneering Sadducee, and is the modern infidel aught but a Sadducee
of later date?</p>
<p>It was dark night before we reached Evora, and having taken
leave of my friends, who kindly requested me to consider their
house my home, I and my servant went to the Largo de San
Francisco, in which, the muleteer informed me, was the best
hostelry of the town.&nbsp; We rode into the kitchen, at the
extreme end of which was the stable, as is customary in <a
name="page1_32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Portugal.&nbsp; The house was kept by an aged gypsy-like
female and her daughter, a fine blooming girl about eighteen
years of age.&nbsp; The house was large.&nbsp; In the upper story
was a very long room, like a granary, which extended nearly the
whole length of the house; the farther part was partitioned off,
and formed a chamber tolerably comfortable, but very cold; and
the floor was of tiles, as was also that of the large room, in
which the muleteers were accustomed to sleep on the furniture of
the mules.&nbsp; After supper I went to bed, and, having offered
up my devotions to Him who had protected me through a dangerous
journey, I slept soundly till the morning.</p>

<p>Evora is a small city, walled, but not regularly fortified,
and could not sustain a siege of a day.&nbsp; It has five gates;
before that to the south-west is the principal promenade of its
inhabitants; the fair on St. John&rsquo;s Day is likewise held
there; the houses are in general very ancient, and many of them
unoccupied.&nbsp; It contains about five thousand inhabitants,
though twice that number would be by no means disproportionate to
its size.&nbsp; The two principal edifices are the See, or
cathedral, <a name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a> and the convent of San Francisco, in
the square before the latter of which was situated the
<i>posada</i> where I had taken up my abode.&nbsp; A large
barrack for cavalry stands on the right-hand side on entering the
south-west gate.&nbsp; To the southeast, at the distance of six
leagues, is to be seen a blue chain of hills, the highest of
which is called Serra Dorso; <a name="citation33b"></a><a
href="#footnote33b" class="citation">[33b]</a> it is
picturesquely beautiful, and contains <a
name="page1_34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>within its
recesses wolves and wild boars in numbers.&nbsp; About a league
and a half on the other side of this hill is Estremoz.</p>
<p>I passed the day succeeding my arrival principally in
examining the town and its environs, and, as I strolled about,
entered into conversation with various people that I met.&nbsp;
Several of these were of the middle class, shopkeepers and
professional men; they were all Constitutionalists, or pretended
to be so, but had very little to say except a few commonplace
remarks on the way of living of the friars, their hypocrisy and
laziness.&nbsp; I endeavoured to obtain some information
respecting the state of instruction in the place, and from their
answers was led to believe that it must be at the lowest ebb, for
it seemed that there was neither book-shop nor school.&nbsp; When
I spoke of religion, they exhibited the utmost apathy for the
subject, and, making their bows, left me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Having a letter of introduction to a person who kept a shop in
the market-place, I went thither and delivered it to him as he
stood behind his counter.&nbsp; In the course of conversation I
found that he had been much persecuted whilst the old system was
in its vigour, and that he entertained a hearty aversion for
it.&nbsp; I told him that the ignorance of the people in
religious matters had served to nurse that system, and that the
surest way to prevent its return was to enlighten their
minds.&nbsp; I added that I had brought a small stock of Bibles
and Testaments to Evora, which I wished to leave for sale in the
hands of some respectable merchant, and that if he were anxious
to help to lay the axe to the root of superstition and tyranny,
he could not do so more effectually than by <a
name="page1_35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>undertaking
the charge of these books.&nbsp; He declared his willingness to
do so, and I went away determined to entrust to him half of my
stock.&nbsp; I returned to the hostelry, and sat down on a log of
wood on the hearth within the immense chimney in the common
apartment; two surly-looking men were on their knees on the
stones.&nbsp; Before them was a large heap of pieces of old iron,
brass, and copper; they were assorting it, and stowing it away in
various bags.&nbsp; They were Spanish contrabandists of the
lowest class, and earned a miserable livelihood by smuggling such
rubbish from Portugal into Spain.&nbsp; Not a word proceeded from
their lips, and when I addressed them in their native language,
they returned no other answer than a kind of growl.&nbsp; They
looked as dirty and rusty as the iron in which they trafficked;
their four miserable donkeys were in the stable in the rear.</p>
<p>The woman of the house and her daughter were exceedingly civil
to me, and coming near crouched down, asking various questions
about England.&nbsp; A man dressed somewhat like an English
sailor, who sat on the other side of the hearth confronting me,
said, &ldquo;I hate the English, for they are not baptized, and
have not the law,&rdquo; meaning the law of God.&nbsp; I laughed,
and told him that according to the law of England, no one who was
unbaptized could be buried in consecrated ground; whereupon he
said, &ldquo;Then you are stricter than we.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
said, &ldquo;What is meant by the lion and the unicorn which I
saw the other day on the coat-of-arms over the door of the
English consul at St. Ubes?&rdquo; <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; I said they
were <a name="page1_36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the
arms of England!&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but
what do they represent?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said I did not know.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you do not know the secrets
of your own house.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Suppose I were to
tell you that they represent the Lion of Bethlehem and the horned
monster of the flaming pit in combat, as to which should obtain
the mastery in England, what would you say?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
replied, &ldquo;I should say that you gave a fair
answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This man and myself became great
friends.&nbsp; He came from Palmella, not far from St. Ubes; he
had several mules and horses with him, and dealt in corn and
barley.&nbsp; I again walked out and roamed in the environs of
the town.</p>
<p>About half a mile from the southern wall is a stone fountain,
where the muleteers and other people who visit the town are
accustomed to water their horses.&nbsp; I sat down by it, and
there I remained about two hours, entering into conversation with
every one who halted at the fountain; and I will here observe,
that during the time of my sojourn at Evora, I repeated my visit
every day, and remained there the same time; and by following
this plan, I believe that I spoke to at least two hundred of the
children of Portugal upon matters relating to their eternal
welfare.&nbsp; I found that very few of those whom I addressed
had received any species of literary education, none of them had
seen the Bible, and not more than half a dozen had the slightest
inkling of what the holy book consisted.&nbsp; I found that most
of them were bigoted Papists and Miguelites at heart.&nbsp; I
therefore, when they told me they were Christians, denied the
possibility of their being so, as they were ignorant of Christ
and his commandments, and placed their hope of salvation on
outward forms <a name="page1_37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>and superstitious observances, which were the invention
of Satan, who wished to keep them in darkness that at last they
might stumble into the pit which he had dug for them.&nbsp; I
said repeatedly that the Pope, whom they revered, was an arch
deceiver, and the head minister of Satan here on earth, and that
the monks and friars, whose absence they so deplored, and to whom
they had been accustomed to confess themselves, were his
subordinate agents.&nbsp; When called upon for proofs, I
invariably cited the ignorance of my auditors respecting the
Scriptures, and said that if their spiritual guides had been
really ministers of Christ, they would not have permitted their
flocks to remain unacquainted with his word.</p>
<p>Since this occurred, I have been frequently surprised that I
experienced no insult and ill-treatment from the people, whose
superstitions I was thus attacking; but I really experienced
none, and am inclined to believe that the utter fearlessness
which I displayed, trusting in the protection of the Almighty,
may have been the cause.&nbsp; When threatened by danger, the
best policy is to fix your eye steadily upon it, and it will in
general vanish like the morning mist before the sun; whereas, if
you quail before it, it is sure to become more imminent.&nbsp; I
have fervent hope that the words of my mouth sank deep into the
hearts of some of my auditors, as I observed many of them depart
musing and pensive.&nbsp; I occasionally distributed tracts
amongst them; for although they themselves were unable to turn
them to much account, I thought that by their means they might
become of service at some future time, and fall into the hands of
others, to whom they might be of eternal interest.&nbsp; Many a
book which is abandoned to the waters is wafted <a
name="page1_38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>to some
remote shore, and there proves a blessing and a comfort to
millions, who are ignorant from whence it came.</p>
<p>The next day, which was Friday, I called at the house of my
friend Don Geronimo Azveto.&nbsp; I did not find him there, but
was directed to the See, or episcopal palace, in an apartment of
which I found him, writing, with another gentleman, to whom he
introduced me; it was the governor of Evora, who welcomed me with
every mark of kindness and affability.&nbsp; After some
discourse, we went out together to examine an ancient edifice,
which was reported to have served, in bygone times, as a temple
to Diana.&nbsp; Part of it was evidently of Roman architecture,
for there was no mistaking the beautiful light pillars which
supported a dome, under which the sacrifices to the most
captivating and poetical divinity of the heathen theocracy had
probably been made; but the original space between the pillars
had been filled up with rubbish of a modern date, and the rest of
the building was apparently of the architecture of the latter end
of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; It was situated at one end of the
building which had once been the seat of the Inquisition, and had
served, before the erection of the present See, as the residence
of the bishop.</p>
<p>Within the See, where the governor now resides, is a superb
library, occupying an immense vaulted room, like the aisle of a
cathedral; and in a side apartment is a collection of paintings
by Portuguese artists, chiefly portraits, amongst which is that
of Don Sebastian. <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; I sincerely hope it did not do
him justice, for it represents him in the shape of an awkward lad
of about eighteen, with a bloated booby <a
name="page1_39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>face with
staring eyes, and a ruff round a short apoplectic neck.</p>
<p>I was shown several beautifully illuminated missals and other
manuscripts, but the one which most arrested my attention, I
scarcely need say why, was that which bore the following
title:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Forma sive ordinatio Capelle
illustrissimi et xianissimi principis Henrici Sexti Regis Anglie
et Francie am dm&#771; Hibernie descripta serenissi&#333;
principi Alfonso Regi Portugalie illustri per humilem servitorem
sm&#771; Willm. Sav. Decan&#363; capelle supradicte</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed a voice from the olden times of my dear native
land!&nbsp; This library and picture-gallery had been formed by
one of the latter bishops, a person of much learning and
piety.</p>
<p>In the evening I dined with Don Geronimo and his brother; the
latter soon left us to attend to his military duties.&nbsp; My
friend and myself had now much conversation of considerable
interest; he lamented the deplorable state of ignorance in which
his countrymen existed at present.&nbsp; He said that his friend
the governor and himself were endeavouring to establish a school
in the vicinity, and that they had made application to the
government for the use of an empty convent, called the
<i>Espinheiro</i>, or thorn-tree, at about a league&rsquo;s
distance, and that they had little <a name="page1_40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>doubt of their request being complied
with.&nbsp; I had before told him who I was; and after expressing
joy at the plan which he had in contemplation, I now urged him in
the most pressing manner to use all his influence to make the
knowledge of the Scripture the basis of the education which the
children were to receive, and added, that half the Bibles and
Testaments which I had brought with me to Evora were heartily at
his service.&nbsp; He instantly gave me his hand, said he
accepted my offer with the greatest pleasure, and would do all in
his power to forward my views, which were in many respects his
own.&nbsp; I now told him that I did not come to Portugal with
the view of propagating the dogmas of any particular sect, but
with the hope of introducing the Bible, which is the well-head of
all that is useful and conducive to the happiness of society;
that I cared not what people called themselves, provided they
followed the Bible as a guide, for that where the Scriptures were
read, neither priestcraft nor tyranny could long exist; and
instanced the case of my own country, the cause of whose freedom
and prosperity was the Bible, and that only, as the last
persecutor of this book, the bloody and infamous Mary, was the
last tyrant who had sat on the throne of England.&nbsp; We did
not part till the night was considerably advanced; and the next
morning I sent him the books, in the firm and confident hope that
a bright and glorious morning was about to rise over the night
which had so long cast its dreary shadows over the regions of the
Alemtejo.</p>
<p>The day after this interesting event, which was Saturday, I
had more conversation with the man from Palmella.&nbsp; I asked
him if in his journeys he had never been attacked by robbers; he
answered <a name="page1_41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>no, for that he generally travelled in company with
others.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were I
alone, I should have little fear, for I am well
protected.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said that I supposed he carried arms
with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;No other arms than this,&rdquo; said he,
pulling out one of those long desperate-looking knives, of
English manufacture, with which every Portuguese peasant is
usually furnished.&nbsp; This knife serves for many purposes, and
I should consider it a far more efficient weapon than a
dagger.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not place
much confidence in the knife.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then inquired in
what rested his hope of protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this,&rdquo;
said he; and, unbuttoning his waistcoat, he showed me a small
bag, attached to his neck by a silken string.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
this bag is an <i>ora&ccedil;am</i>, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> or prayer, written
by a person of power, and as long as I carry it about with me, no
ill can befall me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Curiosity is the leading feature
of my character, and I instantly said, with eagerness, that I
should feel great pleasure in being permitted to read the
prayer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you are my
friend, and I would do for you what I would for few others; I
will show it you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then asked for my penknife,
and, having unripped the bag, took out a large piece of paper
closely folded up.&nbsp; I hurried to my apartment and commenced
the examination of it.&nbsp; It was scrawled over in a very
illegible hand, and was moreover much stained with perspiration,
so that I had considerable difficulty in making myself master of
its contents; but I at last accomplished the following literal
translation of the charm, which was written in bad Portuguese,
but which struck me at the time as being one of the most
remarkable compositions that had ever come to my knowledge.</p>
<h3><a name="page1_42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span><span class="smcap">The Charm</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just Judge and divine Son of the Virgin
Maria, who wast born in Bethlehem, a Nazarene, and wast crucified
in the midst of all Jewry, I beseech thee, O Lord, by thy sixth
day, that the body of me be not caught, nor put to death by the
hands of justice at all; peace be with you, the peace of Christ,
may I receive peace, may you receive peace, said God to his
disciples.&nbsp; If the accursed justice should distrust me, or
have its eyes on me, in order to take me or to rob me, may its
eyes not see me, may its mouth not speak to me, may it have ears
which may not hear me, may it have hands which may not seize me,
may it have feet which may not overtake me; for may I be armed
with the arms of St. George, covered with the cloak of Abraham,
and shipped in the ark of Noah, so that it can neither see me,
nor hear me, nor draw the blood from my body.&nbsp; I also adjure
thee, O Lord, by those three blessed crosses, by those three
blessed chalices, by those three blessed clergymen, by those
three consecrated hosts, that thou give me that sweet company
which thou gavest to the Virgin Maria, from the gates of
Bethlehem to the portals of Jerusalem, that I may go and come
with pleasure and joy with Jesus Christ, the Son of the Virgin
Maria, the prolific yet nevertheless the eternal
virgin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman of the house and her daughter had similar bags
attached to their necks, containing charms, which, they said,
prevented the witches having power to harm them.&nbsp; The belief
in witchcraft is very prevalent amongst the peasantry of the
Alemtejo, <a name="page1_43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>and I believe of other provinces of Portugal.&nbsp; This
is one of the relics of the monkish system, the aim of which, in
all countries where it has existed, seems to have been to besot
the minds of the people, that they might be more easily
misled.&nbsp; All these charms were fabrications of the monks,
who had sold them to their infatuated confessants.&nbsp; The
monks of the Greek and Syrian churches likewise deal in this
ware, which they know to be poison, but which they would rather
vend than the wholesome balm of the Gospel, because it brings
them a large price, and fosters the delusion which enables them
to live a life of luxury.</p>
<p>The Sunday morning was fine, and the plain before the church
of the convent of San Francisco was crowded with people hastening
to or returning from the Mass.&nbsp; After having performed my
morning devotion, and breakfasted, I went down to the kitchen;
the girl Geronima was seated by the fire.&nbsp; I inquired if she
had heard Mass?&nbsp; She replied in the negative, and that she
did not intend to hear it.&nbsp; Upon my inquiring her motive for
absenting herself, she replied, that since the friars had been
expelled from their churches and convents she had ceased to
attend Mass, or to confess herself; for that the government
priests had no spiritual power, and consequently she never
troubled them.&nbsp; She said the friars were holy men and
charitable; for that every morning those of the convent over the
way fed forty poor persons with the relics of the meals of the
preceding day, but that now these people were allowed to
starve.&nbsp; I replied, that the friars, who lived on the fat of
the land, could well afford to bestow a few bones upon their
poor, and that their doing so was merely a part of their policy,
by which they hoped <a name="page1_44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to secure to themselves friends in
time of need.&nbsp; The girl then observed, that, as it was
Sunday, I should perhaps like to see some books, and without
waiting for a reply she produced them.&nbsp; They consisted
principally of popular stories, with lives and miracles of
saints, but amongst them was a translation of Volney&rsquo;s
<i>Ruins of Empires</i>.&nbsp; I expressed a wish to know how she
came possessed of this book.&nbsp; She said that a young man, a
great Constitutionalist, had given it to her some months
previous, and had pressed her much to read it, for that it was
one of the best books in the world.&nbsp; I replied, that the
author of it was an emissary of Satan, and an enemy of Jesus
Christ and the souls of mankind; that it was written with the
sole aim of bringing all religion into contempt, and that it
inculcated the doctrine that there was no future state, nor
reward for the righteous, nor punishment for the wicked.&nbsp;
She made no reply, but, going into another room, returned with
her apron full of dry sticks and brushwood, all which she piled
upon the fire, and produced a bright blaze.&nbsp; She then took
the book from my hand and placed it upon the flaming pile; then,
sitting down, took her rosary out of her pocket, and told her
beads till the volume was consumed.&nbsp; This was an
<i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a> in the best sense of
the word.</p>
<p>On the Monday and Tuesday I paid my usual visits to the
fountain, and likewise rode about the neighbourhood on a mule,
for the purpose of circulating tracts.&nbsp; I dropped a great
many in the favourite walks of the people of Evora, as I felt
rather dubious of their accepting them had I proffered them with
my own <a name="page1_45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>hand, whereas, should they be observed lying on the
ground, I thought that curiosity might cause them to be picked up
and examined.&nbsp; I likewise, on the Tuesday evening, paid a
farewell visit to my friend Azveto, as it was my intention to
leave Evora on the Thursday following and return to Lisbon; in
which view I had engaged a calash of a man who informed me that
he had served as a soldier in the <i>grande arm&eacute;e</i> of
Napoleon, and been present in the Russian campaign.&nbsp; He
looked the very image of a drunkard.&nbsp; His face was covered
with carbuncles, and his breath impregnated with the fumes of
strong waters.&nbsp; He wished much to converse with me in
French, in the speaking of which language it seemed he prided
himself; but I refused, and told him to speak the language of the
country, or I would hold no discourse with him.</p>
<p>Wednesday was stormy, with occasional rain.&nbsp; On coming
down, I found that my friend from Palmella had departed; but
several <i>contrabandistas</i> had arrived from Spain.&nbsp; They
were mostly fine fellows, and, unlike the two I had seen the
preceding week, who were of much lower degree, were chatty and
communicative; they spoke their native language, and no other,
and seemed to hold the Portuguese in great contempt.&nbsp; The
magnificent tones of the Spanish sounded to great advantage
amidst the shrill squeaking dialect of Portugal.&nbsp; I was soon
in deep conversation with them, and was much pleased to find that
all of them could read.&nbsp; I presented the eldest, a man of
about fifty years of age, with a tract in Spanish.&nbsp; He
examined it for some time with great attention; he then rose from
his seat, and, going into the middle of the apartment, began
reading it aloud, slowly and <a name="page1_46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>emphatically.&nbsp; His companions
gathered around him, and every now and then expressed their
approbation of what they heard.&nbsp; The reader occasionally
called upon me to explain passages which, as they referred to
particular texts of Scripture, he did not exactly understand, for
not one of the party had ever seen either the Old or New
Testament.</p>
<p>He continued reading for upwards of an hour, until he had
finished the tract; and, at its conclusion, the whole party were
clamorous for similar ones, with which I was happy to be able to
supply them.</p>
<p>Most of these men spoke of priestcraft and the monkish system
with the utmost abhorrence, and said that they should prefer
death to submitting again to the yoke which had formerly galled
their necks.&nbsp; I questioned them very particularly respecting
the opinion of their neighbours and acquaintances on this point,
and they assured me that in their part of the Spanish frontier
all were of the same mind, and that they cared as little for the
Pope and his monks as they did for Don Carlos; for the latter was
a dwarf, (<i>chicotito</i>), and a tyrant, and the others were
plunderers and robbers.&nbsp; I told them they must beware of
confounding religion with priestcraft, and that in their
abhorrence of the latter they must not forget that there is a God
and a Christ to whom they must look for salvation, and whose word
it was incumbent upon them to study on every occasion; whereupon
they all expressed a devout belief in Christ and the Virgin.</p>
<p>These men, though in many respects more enlightened than the
surrounding peasantry, were in others as much in the dark; they
believed in witchcraft and in the efficacy of particular
charms.&nbsp; The night was very stormy, and at about nine we
heard a galloping <a name="page1_47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>towards the door, and then a loud knocking.&nbsp; It was
opened, and in rushed a wild-looking man, mounted on a donkey; he
wore a ragged jacket of sheepskin, called in Spanish
<i>zamarra</i>, with breeches of the same as far down as his
knees; his legs were bare.&nbsp; Around his <i>sombrero</i>, or
shadowy hat, was tied a large quantity of the herb which in
English is called rosemary, in Spanish <i>romero</i>, and in the
rustic language of Portugal <i>alecrim</i>, <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a> which last is a word of Scandinavian
origin (<i>ellegren</i>), signifying the elfin plant, and was
probably carried into the south by the Vandals.&nbsp; The man
seemed frantic with terror, and said that the witches had been
pursuing him and hovering over his head for the last two
leagues.&nbsp; He came from the Spanish frontier with meal and
other articles.&nbsp; He said that his wife was following him,
and would soon arrive, and in about a quarter of an hour she made
her appearance, dripping with rain, and also mounted on a
donkey.</p>
<p>I asked my friends the <i>contrabandistas</i> why he wore the
rosemary in his hat; whereupon they told me that it was good
against witches and the mischances on the road.&nbsp; I had no
time to argue against this superstition, for, as the chaise was
to be ready at five the next morning, I wished to make the most
of the short time which I could devote to sleep.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Vexatious Delays&mdash;Drunken
Driver&mdash;The Murdered Mule&mdash;The
Lamentation&mdash;Adventure on the Heath&mdash;Fear of
Darkness&mdash;Portuguese Fidalgo&mdash;The Escort&mdash;Return
to Lisbon.</p>
<p>I rose at four, and after having taken some refreshment, I
descended and found the strange man and his wife sleeping in the
chimney corner by the fire, which was still burning.&nbsp; They
soon awoke, and began preparing their breakfast, which consisted
of salt <i>sardinhas</i>, broiled upon the embers.&nbsp; In the
mean time the woman sang snatches of the beautiful hymn, very
common in Spain, which commences thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once of old upon a mountain, shepherds
overcome with sleep,<br />
Near to Bethlehem&rsquo;s holy tower, kept at dead of night their
sheep;<br />
Round about the trunk they nodded of a huge ignited oak,<br />
Whence the crackling flame ascending bright and clear the
darkness broke.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing that I was about to depart, she said, &ldquo;You
shall have some of my husband&rsquo;s rosemary, which will keep
you from danger, and prevent any misfortune
occurring.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was foolish enough to permit her to put
some of it in my hat; and, the <a name="page1_49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>man having by this time arrived with
his mules, I bade farewell to my friendly hostesses, and entered
the chaise with my servant.</p>
<p>I remarked at the time that the mules which drew us were the
finest I had ever seen; the largest could be little short of
sixteen hands high; and the fellow told me in his bad French that
he loved them better than his wife and children.&nbsp; We turned
round the corner of the convent, and proceeded down the street
which leads to the south-western gate.&nbsp; The driver now
stopped before the door of a large house, and, having alighted,
said that it was yet very early, and that he was afraid to
venture forth, as it was very probable we should be robbed, and
himself murdered, as the robbers who resided in the town would be
apprehensive of his discovering them, but that the family who
lived in this house were going to Lisbon, and would depart in
about a quarter of an hour, when we might avail ourselves of an
escort of soldiers which they would take with them, and in their
company we should run no danger.&nbsp; I told him I had no fear,
and commanded him to drive on; but he said he would not, and left
us in the street.&nbsp; We waited an hour, when two carriages
came to the door of the house; but it seems the family were not
yet ready, whereupon the coachman likewise got down, and went
away.&nbsp; At the expiration of about half an hour the family
came out, and when their luggage had been arranged they called
for the coachman, but he was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; Search
was made for him, but ineffectually, and an hour more was spent
before another driver could be procured; but the escort had not
yet made its appearance, and it was not before a servant had been
twice despatched <a name="page1_50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>to the barracks that it arrived.&nbsp; At last
everything was ready, and they drove off.</p>
<p>All this time I had seen nothing of our own coachman, and I
fully expected that he had abandoned us altogether.&nbsp; In a
few minutes I saw him staggering up the street in a state of
intoxication, attempting to sing the <i>Marseillois</i> hymn. <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; I said nothing to him, but sat
observing him.&nbsp; He stood for some time staring at the mules,
and talking incoherent nonsense in French.&nbsp; At last he said,
&ldquo;I am not so drunk but I can ride,&rdquo; and proceeded to
lead his mules towards the gate.&nbsp; When out of the town he
made several ineffectual attempts to mount the smallest mule,
which bore the saddle; he at length succeeded, and instantly
commenced spurring at a furious rate down the road.&nbsp; We
arrived at a place where a narrow rocky path branched off, by
taking which we should avoid a considerable circuit round the
city wall, which otherwise it would be necessary to make before
we could reach the road to Lisbon, which lay at the
north-east.&nbsp; He now said, &ldquo;I shall take this path, for
by so doing we shall overtake the family in a minute;&rdquo; so
into the path we went.&nbsp; It was scarcely wide enough to admit
the carriage, and exceedingly steep and broken.&nbsp; We
proceeded, ascending and descending; the wheels cracked, and the
motion was so violent that we were in danger of being cast out as
from a sling.&nbsp; I saw that if we remained in the carriage it
must be broken in pieces, as our weight must ensure its
destruction.&nbsp; I called to him in Portuguese to stop, but he
flogged and spurred the beasts the more.&nbsp; My man now
entreated me for <a name="page1_51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>God&rsquo;s sake to speak to him in French, for if
anything would pacify him that would.&nbsp; I did so, and
entreated him to let us dismount and walk till we had cleared
this dangerous way.&nbsp; The result justified Antonio&rsquo;s
anticipation.&nbsp; He instantly stopped, and said, &ldquo;Sir,
you are master; you have only to command, and I shall
obey.&rdquo;&nbsp; We dismounted, and walked on till we reached
the great road, when we once more seated ourselves.</p>
<p>The family were about a quarter of a mile in advance, and we
were no sooner reseated than he lashed the mules into full
gallop, for the purpose of overtaking it.&nbsp; His cloak had
fallen from his shoulder, and, in endeavouring to readjust it, he
dropped the string from his hand by which he guided the large
mule: it became entangled in the legs of the poor animal, which
fell heavily on its neck; it struggled for a moment, and then lay
stretched across the way, the shafts over its body.&nbsp; I was
pitched forward into the dirt, and the drunken driver fell upon
the murdered mule.</p>
<p>I was in a great rage, and cried, &ldquo;You drunken renegade,
who are ashamed to speak the language of your own country, you
have broken the staff of your existence, and may now
starve.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Paciencia</i>&rdquo; said he, and
began kicking the head of the mule, in order to make it rise; but
I pushed him down, and taking his knife, which had fallen from
his pocket, cut the bands by which it was attached to the
carriage, but life had fled, and the film of death had begun to
cover its eyes.</p>
<p>The fellow, in the recklessness of intoxication, seemed at
first disposed to make light of his loss, saying, &ldquo;The mule
is dead; it was God&rsquo;s will that she should die; what more
can be said?&nbsp; <i>Paciencia</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile, I
despatched Antonio to the town, for the purpose of <a
name="page1_52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>hiring
mules, and, having taken my baggage from the chaise, waited on
the road-side until he should arrive.</p>
<p>The fumes of the liquor began now to depart from the
fellow&rsquo;s brain; he clasped his hands, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Blessed Virgin, what is to become of me?&nbsp; How am I to
support myself?&nbsp; Where am I to get another mule?&nbsp; For
my mule&mdash;my best mule&mdash;is dead: she fell upon the road,
and died of a sudden!&nbsp; I have been in France, and in other
countries, and have seen beasts of all kinds, but such a mule as
that I have never seen; but she is dead&mdash;my mule is dead:
she fell upon the road, and died of a sudden!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
continued in this strain for a considerable time; and the burden
of his lamentation was always, &ldquo;My mule is dead: she fell
upon the road, and died of a sudden.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length he
took the collar from the creature&rsquo;s neck, and put it upon
the other, which, with some difficulty, he placed in the
shafts.</p>
<p>A beautiful boy of about thirteen now came from the direction
of the town, running along the road with the velocity of a hare:
he stopped before the dead mule, and burst into tears.&nbsp; It
was the man&rsquo;s son, who had heard of the accident from
Antonio.&nbsp; This was too much for the poor fellow; he ran up
to the boy, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; Our bread is
gone, but it is God&rsquo;s will; the mule is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He then flung himself on the ground, uttering fearful
cries.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could have borne my loss,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but when I saw my child cry, I became a fool.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I gave him two or three crowns, and added some words of comfort;
assuring him I had no doubt that, if he abandoned drink, the
Almighty God would take compassion on him and repair his
loss.&nbsp; At length he became more composed, <a
name="page1_53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and,
placing my baggage in the chaise, we returned to the town, where
I found two excellent riding mules awaiting my arrival at the
inn.&nbsp; I did not see the Spanish woman, or I should have told
her of the little efficacy of rosemary in this instance.</p>
<p>I have known several drunkards amongst the Portuguese, but,
without one exception, they have been individuals who, having
travelled abroad, like this fellow, have returned with a contempt
for their own country, and polluted with the worst vices of the
lands which they have visited.</p>
<p>I would strongly advise any of my countrymen who may chance to
read these lines, that, if their fate lead them into Spain or
Portugal, they avoid hiring as domestics, or being connected
with, individuals of the lower classes who speak any other
language than their own, as the probability is that they are
heartless thieves and drunkards.&nbsp; These gentry are
invariably saying all they can in dispraise of their native land;
and it is my opinion, grounded upon experience, that an
individual who is capable of such baseness would not hesitate at
the perpetration of any villany, for next to the love of God, the
love of country is the best preventive of crime.&nbsp; He who is
proud of his country will be particularly cautious not to do
anything which is calculated to disgrace it.</p>
<p>We now journeyed towards Lisbon, and reached Monte Moro about
two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; After taking such refreshment as the
place afforded, we pursued our way till we were within a quarter
of a league of the huts which stand on the edge of the savage
wilderness we had before crossed.&nbsp; Here we were overtaken by
a horseman; he was a powerful, middle-sized man, and was mounted
on a noble Spanish horse.&nbsp; He <a name="page1_54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>had a broad, slouching
<i>sombrero</i> on his head, and wore a jerkin of blue cloth,
with large bosses of silver for buttons, and clasps of the same
metal; he had breeches of yellow leather, and immense jack-boots:
at his saddle was slung a formidable gun.&nbsp; He inquired if I
intended to pass the night at Vendas Novas, and on my replying in
the affirmative, he said that he would avail himself of our
company.&nbsp; He now looked towards the sun, whose disk was
rapidly sinking beneath the horizon, and entreated us to spur on
and make the most of its light, for that the moor was a horrible
place in the dusk.&nbsp; He placed himself at our head, and we
trotted briskly on, the boy, or muleteer, who attended us running
behind without exhibiting the slightest symptom of fatigue.</p>
<p>We entered upon the moor, and had advanced about a mile when
dark night fell around us.&nbsp; We were in a wild path, with
high brushwood on either side, when the rider said that he could
not confront the darkness, and begged me to ride on before, and
he would follow after: I could hear him trembling.&nbsp; I asked
the reason of his terror, and he replied, that at one time
darkness was the same thing to him as day, but that of late years
he dreaded it, especially in wild places.&nbsp; I complied with
his request, but I was ignorant of the way, and, as I could
scarcely see my hand, was continually going wrong.&nbsp; This
made the man impatient, and he again placed himself at our
head.&nbsp; We proceeded so for a considerable way, when he again
stopped, and said that the power of the darkness was too much for
him.&nbsp; His horse seemed to be infected with the same panic,
for it shook in every limb.&nbsp; I now told him to call on the
name of the Lord Jesus, who was able to turn the darkness <a
name="page1_55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>into light;
but he gave a terrible shout, and, brandishing his gun aloft,
discharged it in the air.&nbsp; His horse sprang forward at full
speed, and my mule, which was one of the swiftest of its kind,
took fright and followed at the heels of the charger.&nbsp;
Antonio and the boy were left behind.&nbsp; On we flew like a
whirlwind, the hoofs of the animals illuming the path with the
sparks of fire they struck from the stones.&nbsp; I knew not
whither we were going, but the dumb creatures were acquainted
with the way, and soon brought us to Vendas Novas, where we were
rejoined by our companions.</p>
<p>I thought this man was a coward, but I did him injustice, for
during the day he was as brave as a lion, and feared no
one.&nbsp; About five years since he had overcome two robbers who
had attacked him on the moors, and, after tying their hands
behind them, had delivered them up to justice; but at night the
rustling of a leaf filled him with terror.&nbsp; I have known
similar instances of the kind in persons of otherwise
extraordinary resolution.&nbsp; For myself, I confess I am not a
person of extraordinary resolution, but the dangers of the night
daunt me no more than those of midday.&nbsp; The man in question
was a farmer from Evora, and a person of considerable wealth.</p>
<p>I found the inn at Vendas Novas thronged with people, and had
some difficulty in obtaining accommodation and refreshment.&nbsp;
It was occupied by the family of a certain <i>fidalgo</i> <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a> from Estremoz; he was on the way to
Lisbon, conveying a large sum of money, as was
said&mdash;probably the rents of his estates.&nbsp; He had with
him a body-guard of four and twenty of his dependants, each armed
with a rifle; they <a name="page1_56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>consisted of his shepherds,
swineherds, cowherds, and hunters, and were commanded by two
youths, his son and nephew, the latter of whom was in
regimentals.&nbsp; Nevertheless, notwithstanding the number of
his troop, it appeared that the <i>fidalgo</i> laboured under
considerable apprehension of being despoiled upon the waste which
lay between Vendas Novas and Peg&otilde;es, as he had just
requested a guard of four soldiers from the officer who commanded
a detachment stationed here.&nbsp; There were many females in his
company, who, I was told, were his illegitimate
daughters&mdash;for he bore an infamous moral character, and was
represented to me as a staunch friend of Don Miguel.&nbsp; It was
not long before he came up to me and my new acquaintance, as we
sat by the kitchen fire: he was a tall man of about sixty, but
stooped much.&nbsp; His countenance was by no means pleasing: he
had a long hooked nose, small, twinkling, cunning eyes, and, what
I liked worst of all, a continual sneering smile, which I firmly
believe to be the index of a treacherous and malignant
heart.&nbsp; He addressed me in Spanish, which, as he resided not
far from the frontier, he spoke with fluency; but, contrary to my
usual practice, I was reserved and silent.</p>
<p>On the following morning I rose at seven, and found that the
party from Estremoz had started several hours previously.&nbsp; I
breakfasted with my acquaintance of the preceding night, and we
set out to accomplish what remained of our journey.&nbsp; The sun
had now arisen, and all his fears had left him&mdash;he breathed
defiance against all the robbers of the Alemtejo.&nbsp; When we
had advanced about a league, the boy who attended us said he saw
heads of men amongst the brushwood.&nbsp; Our cavalier instantly
seized his gun, and, causing his horse to make two or three lofty
bounds, <a name="page1_57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>held it in one hand, the muzzle pointed in the direction
indicated; but the heads did not again make their appearance, and
it was probably but a false alarm.</p>
<p>We resumed our way, and the conversation turned, as might be
expected, upon robbers.&nbsp; My companion, who seemed to be
acquainted with every inch of ground over which we passed, had a
legend to tell of every dingle and every pine-clump.&nbsp; We
reached a slight eminence, on the top of which grew three stately
pines: about half a league farther on was another similar
one.&nbsp; These two eminences commanded a view of the road from
Peg&otilde;es and Vendas Novas, so that all people going and
coming could be descried whilst yet at a distance.&nbsp; My
friend told me that these heights were favourite stations of
robbers.&nbsp; Some two years since, a band of six mounted
banditti remained there three days, and plundered whomsoever
approached from either quarter.&nbsp; Their horses, saddled and
bridled, stood picqueted at the foot of the trees, and two
scouts, one for each eminence, continually sat in the topmost
branches, and gave notice of the approach of travellers.&nbsp;
When at a proper distance, the robbers below sprung upon their
horses, and putting them to full gallop, made at their prey,
shouting, &ldquo;<i>Rendete</i>, <i>Picaro</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Rendete</i>, <i>Picaro</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; We, however,
passed unmolested, and, about a quarter of a mile before we
reached Peg&otilde;es, overtook the family of the
<i>fidalgo</i>.</p>
<p>Had they been conveying the wealth of Ind through the deserts
of Arabia, they could not have travelled with more
precaution.&nbsp; The nephew, with drawn sabre, rode in front;
pistols in his holsters, and the usual Spanish gun slung at his
saddle.&nbsp; Behind him <a name="page1_58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>tramped six men in a rank, with
muskets shouldered, and each of them wore at his girdle a
hatchet, which was probably intended to cleave the thieves to the
brisket should they venture to come to close quarters.&nbsp;
There were six vehicles, two of them calashes, in which latter
rode the <i>fidalgo</i> and his daughters; the others were
covered carts, and seemed to be filled with household
furniture.&nbsp; Each of these vehicles had an armed rustic on
either side; and the son, a lad about sixteen, brought up the
rear with a squad equal to that of his cousin in the van.&nbsp;
The soldiers, who, by good fortune, were light horse, and
admirably mounted, were galloping about in all directions, for
the purpose of driving the enemy from cover, should they happen
to be lurking in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I could not help thinking, as I passed by, that this martial
array was very injudicious, for though it was calculated to awe
plunderers, it was likewise calculated to allure them, as it
seemed to hint that immense wealth was passing through their
territories.&nbsp; I do not know how the soldiers and rustics
would have behaved in case of an attack, but am inclined to
believe that if three such men as Richard Turpin had suddenly
galloped forth from behind one of the bush-covered knolls,
neither the numbers nor resistance opposed to them would have
prevented them from bearing away the contents of the strong box
jingling in their saddle-bags.</p>
<p>From this moment nothing worthy of relating occurred till our
arrival at Aldea Gallega, where we passed the night, and next
morning at three o&rsquo;clock embarked in the passage-boat for
Lisbon, where we arrived at eight: and thus terminates my first
wandering in the Alemtejo.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The College&mdash;The
Rector&mdash;Shibboleth&mdash;National Prejudices&mdash;Youthful
Sports&mdash;Jews of Lisbon&mdash;Bad Faith&mdash;Crime and
Superstition.</p>
<p>One afternoon Antonio said to me, &ldquo;It has struck me,
<i>Senhor</i>, <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a> that your worship would like to see
the college of the English . . .&rdquo; <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;pray conduct me thither.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he led
me through various streets until we stopped before the gate of a
large building, in one of the most elevated situations in
Lisbon.&nbsp; Upon our ringing, a kind of porter presently made
his appearance, and demanded our business.&nbsp; Antonio
explained it to him.&nbsp; He hesitated for a moment; but,
presently bidding us enter, conducted us to a large
gloomy-looking stone hall, where, begging us to be seated, he
left us.&nbsp; We were soon joined by a venerable personage,
seemingly about seventy, in a kind of flowing robe or surplice,
with a collegiate cap upon his head.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his
age there was a ruddy tinge upon his features, which were
perfectly English.&nbsp; Coming slowly up he addressed me in the
English tongue, requesting <a name="page1_60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to know how he could serve me.&nbsp;
I informed him that I was an English traveller, and should be
happy to be permitted to inspect the college, provided it were
customary to show it to strangers.&nbsp; He informed me that
there could be no objection to accede to my request, but that I
came at rather an unfortunate moment, it being the hour of
refection.&nbsp; I apologized, and was preparing to retire, but
he begged me to remain, as in a few minutes the refection would
be over, when the principals of the college would do themselves
the pleasure of waiting on me.</p>
<p>We sat down on the stone bench, when he commenced surveying me
attentively for some time, and then cast his eyes on
Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom have we here?&rdquo; said he to the
latter; &ldquo;surely your features are not unknown to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Probably not, your reverence,&rdquo;
replied Antonio, getting up, and bowing most profoundly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I lived in the family of the Countess ---, at Cintra, when
your venerability was her spiritual guide.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, sighing,
&ldquo;I remember you now.&nbsp; Ah, Antonio, things are
strangely changed since then.&nbsp; A new government&mdash;a new
system&mdash;a new religion, I may say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
looking again at me, he demanded whither I was journeying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am going to Spain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and have
stopped at Lisbon by the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Spain,
Spain!&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely you have
chosen a strange time to visit Spain; there is much
blood-shedding in Spain at present, and violent wars and
tumults.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I consider the cause of Don Carlos
as already crushed,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;he has lost the only
general capable of leading his armies to Madrid.&nbsp;
Zumalacarregui, his Cid, has fallen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not
flatter yourself; I beg your pardon, but do not think, young man,
that the Lord <a name="page1_61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>will permit the powers of darkness to triumph so
easily.&nbsp; The cause of Don Carlos is not lost: its success
did not depend on the life of a frail worm like him whom you have
mentioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; We continued in discourse some little
time, when he arose, saying that by this time he believed the
refection was concluded.</p>
<p>He had scarcely left me five minutes when three individuals
entered the stone hall, and advanced slowly towards me.&nbsp; The
principals of the college, said I to myself; and so indeed they
were.&nbsp; The first of these gentlemen, and to whom the other
two appeared to pay considerable deference, was a thin, spare
person, somewhat above the middle height; his complexion was very
pale, his features emaciated but fine, his eyes dark and
sparkling; he might be about fifty.&nbsp; The other two were men
in the prime of life.&nbsp; One was of rather low stature; his
features were dark, and wore that pinched and mortified
expression so frequently to be observed in the countenance of the
English . . .: the other was a bluff, ruddy, and rather
good-looking young man.&nbsp; All three were dressed alike in the
usual college cap and silk gown.&nbsp; Coming up, the eldest of
the three took me by the hand, and thus addressed me in clear
silvery tones:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, sir, to our poor house.&nbsp; We are always
happy to see in it a countryman from our beloved native land; it
will afford us extreme satisfaction to show you over it; it is
true that satisfaction is considerably diminished by the
reflection that it possesses nothing worthy of the attention of a
traveller; there is nothing curious pertaining to it save,
perhaps, its economy, and that, as we walk about, we will explain
<a name="page1_62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>to
you.&nbsp; Permit us, first of all, to introduce ourselves to
you.&nbsp; I am rector of this poor English house of refuge; this
gentleman is our professor of humanity; and this&rdquo; (pointing
to the ruddy personage) &ldquo;is our professor of polite
learning, Hebrew, and Syriac.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I humbly salute you all.&nbsp; Excuse me
if I inquire who was the venerable gentleman who put himself to
the inconvenience of staying with me whilst I was awaiting your
leisure.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;Oh, a most admirable personage, our
almoner, our chaplain; he came into this country before any of us
were born, and here he has continued ever since.&nbsp; Now let us
ascend that we may show you our poor house.&nbsp; But how is
this, my dear sir, how is it that I see you standing uncovered in
our cold, damp hall?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I can easily explain that to you; it is a
custom which has become quite natural to me.&nbsp; I am just
arrived from Russia, where I have spent some years.&nbsp; A
Russian invariably takes off his hat whenever he enters beneath a
roof, whether it pertain to hut, shop, or palace.&nbsp; To omit
doing so would be considered as a mark of brutality and
barbarism, and for the following reason: in every apartment of a
Russian house there is a small picture of the Virgin stuck up in
a corner, just below the ceiling&mdash;the hat is taken off out
of respect to her.</p>
<p>Quick glances of intelligence were exchanged by the three
gentlemen.&nbsp; I had stumbled upon their shibboleth, and
proclaimed myself an Ephraimite, and not of Gilead.&nbsp; I have
no doubt that up to that moment they had considered me as one of
themselves&mdash;a member, and perhaps a priest, of their own
ancient, grand, and imposing religion, for such it is, I must <a
name="page1_63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>confess&mdash;an error into which it was natural that
they should fall.&nbsp; What motives could a Protestant have for
intruding upon their privacy?&nbsp; What interest could he take
in inspecting the economy of their establishment?&nbsp; So far,
however, from relaxing in their attention after this discovery,
their politeness visibly increased, though, perhaps, a
scrutinizing observer might have detected a shade of less
cordiality in their manner.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;Beneath the ceiling in every
apartment?&nbsp; I think I understood you so.&nbsp; How
delightful&mdash;how truly interesting; a picture of the Blessed
Virgin beneath the ceiling in every apartment of a Russian
house!&nbsp; Truly, this intelligence is as unexpected as it is
delightful.&nbsp; I shall from this moment entertain a much
higher opinion of the Russians than hitherto&mdash;most truly an
example worthy of imitation.&nbsp; I wish sincerely that it was
our own practice to place an image of the Blessed Virgin beneath
the ceiling in every corner of our houses.&nbsp; What say you,
our professor of humanity?&nbsp; What say you to the information
so obligingly communicated to us by this excellent gentleman?</p>
<p><i>Humanity Professor</i>.&mdash;It is indeed most delightful,
most cheering, I may say; but I confess that I was not altogether
unprepared for it.&nbsp; The adoration of the Blessed Virgin is
becoming every day more extended in countries where it has
hitherto been unknown or forgotten.&nbsp; Dr. W---, when he
passed through Lisbon, gave me some most interesting details with
respect to the labours of the propaganda in India.&nbsp; Even
England, our own beloved country. . . .</p>
<p>My obliging friends showed me all over their &ldquo;poor
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It certainly did not appear a very rich one;
<a name="page1_64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>it was
spacious, but rather dilapidated.&nbsp; The library was small,
and possessed nothing remarkable; the view, however, from the
roof, over the greater part of Lisbon and the Tagus, was very
grand and noble.&nbsp; But I did not visit this place in the hope
of seeing busts, or books, or fine prospects,&mdash;I visited
this strange old house to converse with its inmates; for my
favourite, I might say my only, study is man.&nbsp; I found these
gentlemen much what I had anticipated; for this was not the first
time that I had visited an English . . . establishment in a
foreign land.&nbsp; They were full of amiability and courtesy to
their heretic countryman, and though the advancement of their
religion was with them an object of paramount importance, I soon
found that, with ludicrous inconsistency, they cherished, to a
wonderful degree, national prejudices almost extinct in the
mother land, even to the disparagement of those of their own
darling faith.&nbsp; I spoke of the English . . ., of their high
respectability, and of the loyalty which they had uniformly
displayed to their sovereign, though of a different religion, and
by whom they had been not unfrequently subjected to much
oppression and injustice.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;My dear sir, I am rejoiced to hear you; I
see that you are well acquainted with the great body of those of
our faith in England.&nbsp; They are, as you have well described
them, a most respectable and loyal body; from loyalty, indeed,
they never swerved, and though they have been accused of plots
and conspiracies, it is now well known that such had no real
existence, but were merely calumnies invented by their religious
enemies.&nbsp; During the civil wars the English . . . cheerfully
shed their blood and squandered their fortunes in the cause of
the unfortunate martyr, <a name="page1_65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>notwithstanding that he never
favoured them, and invariably looked upon them with
suspicion.&nbsp; At present the English . . . are the most
devoted subjects of our gracious sovereign.&nbsp; I should be
happy if I could say as much for our Irish brethren; but their
conduct has been&mdash;oh, detestable!&nbsp; Yet what can you
expect?&nbsp; The true . . . blush for them.&nbsp; A certain
person is a disgrace to the church of which he pretends to be the
servant.&nbsp; Where does he find in our canons sanction for his
proceedings, his undutiful expressions towards one who is his
sovereign by divine right, and who can do no wrong?&nbsp; And
above all, where does he find authority for inflaming the
passions of a vile mob against a nation intended by nature and by
position to command them?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I believe there is an Irish college in
this city?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;I believe there is; but it does not
flourish; there are few or no pupils.&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p>I looked through a window, at a great height, and saw about
twenty or thirty fine lads sporting in a court below.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is as it should be,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;those boys
will not make worse priests from a little early devotion to
trap-ball and cudgel playing.&nbsp; I dislike a staid, serious,
puritanic education, as I firmly believe that it encourages vice
and hypocrisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We then went into the Rector&rsquo;s room, where, above a
crucifix, was hanging a small portrait.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;That was a great and portentous man,
honest withal.&nbsp; I believe the body of which he was the
founder, and which has been so much decried, has effected
infinitely more good than it has caused harm.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;What do I hear?&nbsp; You, an Englishman,
<a name="page1_66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and a
Protestant, and yet an admirer of Ignatius Loyola?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I will say nothing with respect to the
doctrine of the Jesuits, for, as you have observed, I am a
Protestant; but I am ready to assert that there are no people in
the world better qualified, upon the whole, to be entrusted with
the education of youth.&nbsp; Their moral system and discipline
are truly admirable.&nbsp; Their pupils, in after-life, are
seldom vicious and licentious characters, and are in general men
of learning, science, and possessed of every elegant
accomplishment.&nbsp; I execrate the conduct of the liberals of
Madrid in murdering last year the helpless fathers, by whose care
and instruction two of the finest minds of Spain have been
evolved&mdash;the two ornaments of the liberal cause and modern
literature of Spain, for such are Toreno and Martinez de la Rosa.

<p>Gathered in small clusters about the pillars at the lower
extremities of the gold and silver streets in Lisbon, may be
observed, about noon in every day, certain strange-looking men
whose appearance is neither Portuguese nor European.&nbsp; Their
dress generally consists of a red cap, with a blue silken tassel
at the top of it, a blue tunic girded at the waist with a red
sash, and wide linen pantaloons or trousers.&nbsp; He who passes
by these groups generally hears them conversing in broken Spanish
or Portuguese, and occasionally in a harsh guttural language,
which the <a name="page1_67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>oriental traveller knows to be the Arabic, or a dialect
thereof.&nbsp; These people are the Jews of Lisbon. <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a>&nbsp; Into the midst of one of these
groups I one day introduced myself, and pronounced a
<i>beraka</i>, or blessing.&nbsp; I have lived in different parts
of the world, much amongst the Hebrew race, and am well
acquainted with their ways and phraseology.&nbsp; I was rather
anxious to become acquainted with the state of the Portuguese
Jews, and I had now an opportunity.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man is a
powerful rabbi,&rdquo; said a voice in Arabic; &ldquo;it behoves
us to treat him kindly.&rdquo;&nbsp; They welcomed me.&nbsp; I
favoured their mistake, and in a few days I knew all that related
to them and their traffic in Lisbon. <a name="citation67b"></a><a
href="#footnote67b" class="citation">[67b]</a></p>
<p>The Jews of Europe at the present time are divided into two
classes&mdash;synagogues, as some call them&mdash;the Portuguese
and German.&nbsp; Of these the most celebrated is the
Portuguese.&nbsp; Jews of this class are generally considered as
more polished than the others, better educated, and more deeply
versed both in the language of Scripture and the traditions of
their forefathers.&nbsp; In London there is a stately edifice
which is termed the synagogue of the Portuguese Jews, where the
rites of the Hebrew religion are performed with all possible
splendour and magnificence.&nbsp; Knowing all this, one would
naturally expect, on arriving in Portugal, to find one&rsquo;s
self in the head-quarters of that Judaism <a
name="page1_68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>with which
the mind has been accustomed to associate so much that is
respectable and imposing.&nbsp; It was, therefore, with feelings
of considerable surprise that I heard from the beings, whom I
have attempted to describe above, the following account of
themselves:&mdash;&ldquo;We are not of Portugal,&rdquo; said
they; &ldquo;we come from Barbary, some from Algier, some from
the Levant, but mostly from Barbary, yonder-away!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they pointed to the south-west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are the Jews of Portugal,&rdquo; I demanded:
&ldquo;the proper children of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know of none but ourselves,&rdquo; replied the
Barbaresques, &ldquo;though we have heard say that there are
others: if so, they do not come near us, and they do right, for
we are an evil people, O thou <i>Tsadik</i>, and thieves to a
man.&nbsp; A ship comes every year from Swirah; <a
name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a> it brings a cargo of thieves, for it
brings Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your wives and families,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Swirah, or Salee, or other places from whence we
come.&nbsp; We bring not our wives with us, nor our families:
many of us have escaped hither barely with life, flying from the
punishment due to our crimes.&nbsp; Some live in sin with the
daughters of the Nazarene: for we are an evil race, O
<i>Tsadik</i>, and do not observe the precepts of the
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you synagogues and teachers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, O thou righteous one, yet little can be said of
either: our <i>chenourain</i> are vile places, and our teachers
are like ourselves, bound in the <i>galoot</i> of sin.&nbsp; One
of them keeps in his house a daughter of the <a
name="page1_69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Nazarene;
he is from Swirah, and what good ever came from that
shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say your teachers are evil: do ye hearken unto
their words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we hearken unto them: how could we do else
and live?&nbsp; Our teachers are evil men, and live by fraud,
like ourselves; yet still are they masters, men to be dreaded and
obeyed.&nbsp; Have they not witchcraft at their command, and
angels?&nbsp; Have they not words of power, and the <i>Shem
Hamphorash</i>? <a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"
class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; Were we not to hearken to them,
could they not consign our souls to horror, to mist and vapour,
to mire and clay?&nbsp; Even as thou couldst, O righteous
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the extraordinary language in connexion with
themselves which they held to me, and which I have no reason to
doubt, as it was subsequently corroborated in more ways than
one.&nbsp; How well do superstition and crime go hand in
hand!&nbsp; These wretched beings break the eternal commandments
of their Maker without scruple; but they will not partake of the
beast of the uncloven foot, and the fish which has no
scales.&nbsp; They pay slight regard to the denunciations of holy
prophets against the children of sin, but they quake at the sound
of a dark cabalistic word pronounced by one perhaps their equal
or superior in villany; as if, as has been well observed, God
would delegate the exercise of his power to the workers of
iniquity.</p>
<p>It is quite certain that at one period the Jews of Portugal
were deservedly celebrated for wealth, learning, and polished
manners; the Inquisition, however, played sad havoc with
them.&nbsp; Those who escaped <a name="page1_70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the <i>auto da f&eacute;</i>, without
becoming converts to Popish idolatry, took refuge in foreign
lands, particularly in England, where they still retain their
original designation.&nbsp; At present, notwithstanding all
religions are tolerated in Portugal, the genuine Jews of the
country do not show themselves; <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a> in their stead are
seen the rabble of Barbary, and these only in the streets of
Lisbon&mdash;outcasts who make no secret of their own
degradation.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after my return from Evora, having made the
necessary preparations, I set out on my journey for Badajoz, from
which town I intended to take the diligence to Madrid.&nbsp;
Badajoz lies about a hundred miles distant from Lisbon, and is
the principal frontier town of Spain in the direction of the
Alemtejo.&nbsp; To reach this place, it was necessary to
re-travel the road as far as Monte Moro, which I had already
passed in my excursion to Evora; I had therefore very little
pleasure to anticipate from novelty of scenery.&nbsp; Moreover,
in this journey I should be a solitary traveller, with no other
companion than the muleteer, as it was my intention to take my
servant no farther than Aldea Gallega, for which place I started
at four in the afternoon.&nbsp; Warned by former experience, I
did not now embark in a small boat, but in one of the regular
passage felouks, in which we reached Aldea Gallega, after a
voyage of six hours; for the boat was heavy, there was no wind to
propel it, and the crew were obliged to ply their huge oars the
whole way.&nbsp; In a word, this passage was the <a
name="page1_72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>reverse of
the first&mdash;safe in every respect, but so sluggish and
tiresome, that I a hundred times wished myself again under the
guidance of the wild lad, galloping before the hurricane over the
foaming billows.&nbsp; From eight till ten the cold was truly
terrible, and though I was closely wrapped in an excellent fur
<i>shoob</i>, with which I had braved the frosts of Russian
winters, I shivered in every limb, and was far more rejoiced when
I again set my foot on the Alemtejo, than when I landed for the
first time, after having escaped the horrors of the tempest.</p>
<p>I took up my quarters for the night at a house to which my
friend who feared the darkness had introduced me on my return
from Evora, and where, though I paid mercilessly dear for
everything, the accommodation was superior to that of the common
inn in the square.&nbsp; My first care now was to inquire for
mules to convey myself and baggage to Elvas, from whence there
are but three short leagues to the Spanish town of Badajoz.&nbsp;
The people of the house informed me that they had an excellent
pair at my disposal, but when I inquired the price, they were not
ashamed to demand four <i>moidores</i>.&nbsp; I offered them
three, which was too much, but which, however, they did not
accept; for, knowing me to be an Englishman, they thought they
had an excellent opportunity to practise imposition, not
imagining that a person so rich as an Englishman <i>must</i> be,
would go out in a cold night for the sake of obtaining a
reasonable bargain.&nbsp; They were, however, much mistaken, as I
told them that rather than encourage them in their knavery I
should be content to return to Lisbon; whereupon they dropped
their demand to three and a half; but I made them no answer, and,
going out <a name="page1_73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>with Antonio, proceeded to the house of the old man who
had accompanied us to Evora.&nbsp; We knocked a considerable
time, for he was in bed; at length he arose and admitted us, but
on hearing our object, he said that his mules were again gone to
Evora, under the charge of the boy, for the purpose of
transporting some articles of merchandize.&nbsp; He, however,
recommended us to a person in the neighbourhood who kept mules
for hire, and there Antonio engaged two fine beasts for two
<i>moidores</i> and a half.&nbsp; I say <i>he</i> engaged them,
for I stood aloof and spoke not, and the proprietor, who
exhibited them, and who stood half dressed, with a lamp in his
hand, and shivering with cold, was not aware that they were
intended for a foreigner till the agreement was made, and he had
received a part of the sum in earnest.&nbsp; I returned to the
inn well pleased, and having taken some refreshment, went to
rest, paying little attention to the people, who glanced daggers
at me from their small Jewish eyes.</p>
<p>At five the next morning the mules were at the door.&nbsp; A
lad of some nineteen or twenty years of age attended them.&nbsp;
He was short, but exceedingly strong built, and possessed the
largest head which I ever beheld upon mortal shoulders; neck he
had none, at least I could discern nothing which could be
entitled to that name.&nbsp; His features were hideously ugly,
and upon addressing him I discovered that he was an idiot.&nbsp;
Such was my intended companion in a journey of nearly a hundred
miles, which would occupy four days, and which lay over the most
savage and ill-noted track in the whole kingdom.&nbsp; I took
leave of my servant almost with tears, for he had always served
me with the greatest fidelity, and had exhibited an <a
name="page1_74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>assiduity
and a wish to please which afforded me the utmost
satisfaction.</p>
<p>We started, my uncouth guide sitting tailor-fashion on the
sumpter mule, upon the baggage.&nbsp; The moon had just gone
down, and the morning was pitchy dark, and, as usual, piercingly
cold.&nbsp; We soon entered the dismal wood, which I had already
traversed, and through which we wended our way for some time,
slowly and mournfully.&nbsp; Not a sound was to be heard save the
trampling of the animals, not a breath of air moved the leafless
branches, no animal stirred in the thickets, no bird, not even
the owl, flew over our heads, all seemed desolate and dead; and
during my many and far wanderings, I never experienced a greater
sensation of loneliness, and a greater desire for conversation
and an exchange of ideas than then.&nbsp; To speak to the idiot
was useless, for though competent to show the road, with which he
was well acquainted, he had no other answer than an uncouth laugh
to any question put to him.&nbsp; Thus situated, like many other
persons when human comfort is not at hand, I turned my heart to
God, and began to commune with Him, the result of which was that
my mind soon became quieted and comforted.</p>
<p>We passed on our way uninterrupted; no thieves showed
themselves, nor indeed did we see a single individual until we
arrived at Peg&otilde;es, and from thence to Vendas Novas our
fortune was the same.&nbsp; I was welcomed with great kindness by
the people of the hostelry of the latter place, who were well
acquainted with me on account of my having twice passed the night
under their roof.&nbsp; The name of the keeper of this inn is, or
was, Joz&eacute; Dias Azido, and, unlike the generality of those
of the same profession as himself <a name="page1_75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>in Portugal, he is an honest man; and
a stranger and foreigner who takes up his quarters at his inn may
rest assured that he will not be most unmercifully pillaged and
cheated when the hour of reckoning shall arrive, as he will not
be charged a single <i>r&eacute;</i> <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a> more than a native
Portuguese on a similar occasion.&nbsp; I paid at this place
exactly one-half of the sum which was demanded from me at
Arroyolos, where I passed the ensuing night, and where the
accommodation was in every respect inferior.</p>
<p>At twelve next day we arrived at Monte Moro, and, as I was not
pressed for time, I determined upon viewing the ruins which cover
the top and middle part of the stately hill which towers above
the town.&nbsp; Having ordered some refreshment at the inn where
we dismounted, I ascended till I arrived at a large wall or
rampart, which, at a certain altitude, embraces the whole
hill.&nbsp; I crossed a rude bridge of stones, which bestrides a
small hollow or trench; and passing by a large tower, entered
through a portal into the enclosed part of the hill.&nbsp; On the
left hand stood a church, in good preservation, and still devoted
to the purposes of religion, but which I could not enter, as the
door was locked, and I saw no one at hand to open it.</p>
<p>I soon found that my curiosity had led me to a most
extraordinary place, which quite beggars the scanty powers of
description with which I am gifted.&nbsp; I stumbled on amongst
ruined walls, and at one time found I was treading over vaults,
as I suddenly started back from a yawning orifice into which my
next step, as I strolled musing along, would have precipitated
me.&nbsp; I proceeded for a considerable way by the <a
name="page1_76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>eastern
wall, till I heard a tremendous bark, and presently an immense
dog, such as those which guard the flocks in the neighbourhood
against the wolves, came bounding to attack me &ldquo;with eyes
that glowed, and fangs that grinned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had I
retreated, or had recourse to any other mode of defence than that
which I invariably practise under such circumstances, he would
probably have worried me; but I stooped till my chin nearly
touched my knee, and looked him full in the eyes, and, as John
Leyden says, in the noblest ballad which the Land of Heather has
produced:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The hound he yowled, and back he fled,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As struck with fairy charm.&rdquo; <a
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a fact known to many people, and I believe it has been
frequently stated, that no large and fierce dog or animal of any
kind, with the exception of the bull, which shuts its eyes and
rushes blindly forward, will venture to attack an individual who
confronts it with a firm and motionless countenance.&nbsp; I say
large and fierce, for it is much easier to repel a bloodhound or
bear of Finland in this manner than a dung-hill cur or a terrier,
against which a stick or a stone is a much more certain
defence.&nbsp; This will astonish no one who considers that the
calm reproving glance <a name="page1_77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>of reason, which allays the excesses
of the mighty and courageous in our own species, has seldom any
other effect than to add to the insolence of the feeble and
foolish, who become placid as doves upon the infliction of
chastisements, which, if attempted to be applied to the former,
would only serve to render them more terrible, and, like
gunpowder cast on a flame, cause them, in mad desperation, to
scatter destruction around them.</p>
<p>The barking of the dog brought out from a kind of alley an
elderly man, whom I supposed to be his master, and of whom I made
some inquiries respecting the place.&nbsp; The man was civil, and
informed me that he served as a soldier in the British army,
under the &ldquo;great lord,&rdquo; during the Peninsula
war.&nbsp; He said that there was a convent of nuns a little
farther on, which he would show me, and thereupon led the way to
the south-east part of the wall, where stood a large dilapidated
edifice.</p>
<p>We entered a dark stone apartment, at one corner of which was
a kind of window occupied by a turning table, at which articles
were received into the convent or delivered out.&nbsp; He rang
the bell, and, without saying a word, retired, leaving me rather
perplexed; but presently I heard, though the speaker was
invisible, a soft feminine voice demanding who I was, and what I
wanted.&nbsp; I replied, that I was an Englishman travelling into
Spain; and that, passing through Monte Moro, I had ascended the
hill for the purpose of seeing the ruins.&nbsp; The voice then
said, &ldquo;I suppose you are a military man going to fight
against the king, like the rest of your countrymen?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am not a military man, but a
Christian; and I go not to shed blood, but to endeavour to
introduce <a name="page1_78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>the gospel of Christ into a country where it is not
known;&rdquo; whereupon there was a stifled titter.&nbsp; I then
inquired if there were any copies of the Holy Scriptures in the
convent; but the friendly voice could give me no information on
that point, and I scarcely believe that its possessor understood
the purport of my question.&nbsp; It informed me, that the office
of lady abbess of the house was an annual one, and that every
year there was a fresh superior.&nbsp; On my inquiring whether
the nuns did not frequently find the time exceedingly heavy on
their hands, it stated that, when they had nothing better to do,
they employed themselves in making cheesecakes, which were
disposed of in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I thanked the voice for
its communications, and walked away.&nbsp; Whilst proceeding
under the wall of the house towards the south-west, I heard a
fresh and louder tittering above my head, and, looking up, saw
three or four windows crowded with dusky faces, and black waving
hair; these belonged to the nuns, anxious to obtain a view of the
stranger.&nbsp; After kissing my hand repeatedly, I moved on, and
soon arrived at the south-west end of this mountain of
curiosities.&nbsp; There I found the remains of a large building,
which seemed to have been originally erected in the shape of a
cross.&nbsp; A tower at its eastern entrance was still entire;
the western side was quite in ruins, and stood on the verge of
the hill overlooking the valley, at the bottom of which ran the
stream I have spoken of on a former occasion.</p>
<p>The day was intensely hot, notwithstanding the coldness of the
preceding nights; and the brilliant sun of Portugal now illumined
a landscape of entrancing beauty.&nbsp; Groves of cork-trees
covered the <a name="page1_79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>farther side of the valley and the distant acclivities,
exhibiting here and there charming vistas, where various flocks
of cattle were feeding; the soft murmur of the stream, which was
at intervals chafed and broken by huge stones, ascended to my
ears and filled my mind with delicious feelings.&nbsp; I sat down
on the broken wall and remained gazing, and listening, and
shedding tears of rapture; for of all the pleasures which a
bountiful God permitteth his children to enjoy, none are so dear
to some hearts as the music of forests and streams, and the view
of the beauties of his glorious creation.&nbsp; An hour elapsed,
and I still maintained my seat on the wall; the past scenes of my
life flitting before my eyes in airy and fantastic array, through
which every now and then peeped trees and hills, and other
patches of the real landscape which I was confronting.&nbsp; The
sun burnt my visage, but I heeded it not; and I believe that I
should have remained till night, buried in these reveries, which,
I confess, only serve to enervate the mind and steal many a
minute which might be more profitably employed, had not the
report of the gun of a fowler in the valley, which awakened the
echoes of the woods, hills, and ruins, caused me to start on my
feet, and remember that I had to proceed three leagues before I
could reach the hostelry where I intended to pass the night.</p>
<p>I bent my steps to the inn, passing along a kind of
rampart.&nbsp; Shortly before I reached the portal, which I have
already mentioned, I observed a kind of vault on my right hand,
scooped out of the side of the hill; its roof was supported by
three pillars, though part of it had given way towards the
farther end, so that the light was admitted through a chasm <a
name="page1_80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>in the
top.&nbsp; It might have been intended for a chapel, a dungeon,
or a cemetery, but I should rather think for the latter.&nbsp;
One thing I am certain of, that it was not the work of Moorish
hands; and indeed throughout my wandering in this place I saw
nothing which reminded me of that most singular people.&nbsp; The
hill on which the ruins stand was doubtless originally a strong
fortress of the Moors, who, upon their first irruption into the
peninsula, seized and fortified most of the lofty and naturally
strong positions, but they had probably lost it at an early
period, so that the broken walls and edifices, which at present
cover the hill, are probably remains of the labours of the
Christians after the place had been rescued from the hands of the
terrible enemies of their faith.&nbsp; Monte Moro will perhaps
recall Cintra to the mind of the traveller, as it exhibits a
distant resemblance to that place; nevertheless, there is
something in Cintra wild and savage, to which Monte Moro has no
pretension.&nbsp; Its scathed and gigantic crags are piled upon
each other in a manner which seems to menace headlong destruction
to whatever is in the neighbourhood; and the ruins which still
cling to those crags seem more like eagles&rsquo; nests than the
remains of the habitations even of Moors; whereas those of Monte
Moro stand comparatively at their ease on the broad back of a
hill, which, though stately and commanding, has no crags nor
precipices, and which can be ascended on every side without much
difficulty.&nbsp; Yet I was much gratified by my visit, and I
shall wander far indeed before I forget the voice in the
dilapidated convent, the ruined walls amongst which I strayed,
and the rampart, where, sunk in dreamy rapture, I sat during a
bright sunny hour at Monte Moro.</p>
<p><a name="page1_81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>I
returned to the inn, where I refreshed myself with tea and very
sweet and delicious cheesecakes, the handiwork of the nuns in the
convent above.&nbsp; Observing gloom and unhappiness on the
countenances of the people of the house, I inquired the reason of
the hostess, who sat almost motionless on the hearth by the fire;
whereupon she informed me that her husband was deadly sick with a
disorder which, from her description, I supposed to be a species
of cholera; she added, that the surgeon who attended him
entertained no hopes of his recovery.&nbsp; I replied that it was
quite in the power of God to restore her husband in a few hours
from the verge of the grave to health and vigour, and that it was
her duty to pray to that Omnipotent Being with all
fervency.&nbsp; I added, that if she did not know how to pray
upon such an occasion, I was ready to pray for her, provided she
would join in the spirit of the supplication.&nbsp; I then
offered up a short prayer in Portuguese, in which I entreated the
Lord to remove, if he thought proper, the burden of affliction
under which the family was labouring.</p>
<p>The woman listened attentively, with her hands devoutly
clasped, until the prayer was finished, and then gazed at me
seemingly with astonishment, but uttered no word by which I could
gather that she was pleased or displeased with what I had
said.&nbsp; I now bade the family farewell, and having mounted my
mule, set forward to Arroyolos. <a name="citation81"></a><a

<p>After proceeding about a league and a half, a blast came
booming from the north, rolling before it immense clouds of dust;
happily it did not blow in our faces, or it would have been
difficult to proceed, so great was its violence.&nbsp; We had
left the road in order to take advantage of one of those short
cuts, which, though passable for a horse or a mule, are far too
rough to permit any species of carriage to travel along
them.&nbsp; We were in the midst of sands, brushwood, and huge
pieces of rock, which thickly studded the ground.&nbsp; These are
the stones which form the <i>sierras</i> of Spain and Portugal;
those singular mountains which rise in naked horridness, like the
ribs of some mighty carcass from which the flesh has been
torn.&nbsp; Many of these stones, or rocks, grew out of the
earth, and many lay on its surface unattached, perhaps wrested
from their beds by the waters of the deluge.&nbsp; Whilst toiling
along these wild wastes, I observed, a little way to my left, a
pile of stones of rather a singular appearance, and rode up to
it.&nbsp; It was a Druidical altar, and the most perfect <a
name="page1_83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and
beautiful one of the kind which I had ever seen.&nbsp; It was
circular, and consisted of stones immensely large and heavy at
the bottom, which towards the top became thinner and thinner,
having been fashioned by the hand of art to something of the
shape of scollop shells.&nbsp; These were surmounted by a very
large flat stone, which slanted down towards the south, where was
a door.&nbsp; Three or four individuals might have taken shelter
within the interior, in which was growing a small thorn-tree.</p>
<p>I gazed with reverence and awe upon the pile where the first
colonies of Europe offered their worship to the unknown God. <a
name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a>&nbsp; The temples of the mighty and
skilful Roman, comparatively of modern date, have crumbled to
dust in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; The churches of the Arian Goth,
his successor in power, have sunk beneath the earth, and are not
to be found; and the mosques of the Moor, the conqueror of the
Goth, where and what are they?&nbsp; Upon the rock, masses of
hoary and vanishing ruin.&nbsp; Not so the Druid&rsquo;s stone;
there it stands on the hill of winds, as strong and as freshly
new as the day, perhaps thirty centuries back, when it was first
raised, by means which are a mystery.&nbsp; Earthquakes have
heaved it, but its cope-stone has not fallen; rain floods have
deluged it, but failed to sweep it from its station; the burning
sun has flashed upon it, but neither split nor crumbled it; and
time, stern old time, has rubbed it with his iron tooth, and with
what effect let those who view it declare.&nbsp; There it stands,
and he who wishes to study the literature, the learning, and the
history of the ancient Celt and Cymbrian, <a
name="page1_84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>may gaze on
its broad covering, and glean from that blank stone the whole
known amount.&nbsp; The Roman has left behind him his deathless
writings, his history, and his songs; the Goth his liturgy, his
traditions, and the germs of noble institutions; the Moor his
chivalry, his discoveries in medicine, and the foundations of
modern commerce; and where is the memorial of the Druidic
races?&nbsp; Yonder: that pile of eternal stone!</p>
<p>We arrived at Arroyolos about seven at night.&nbsp; I took
possession of a large two-bedded room, and, as I was preparing to
sit down to supper, the hostess came to inquire whether I had any
objection to receive a young Spaniard for the night.&nbsp; She
said he had just arrived with a train of muleteers, and that she
had no other room in which she could lodge him.&nbsp; I replied
that I was willing, and in about half an hour he made his
appearance, having first supped with his companions.&nbsp; He was
a very gentlemanly, good-looking lad of seventeen.&nbsp; He
addressed me in his native language, and, finding that I
understood him, he commenced talking with astonishing
volubility.&nbsp; In the space of five minutes he informed me
that, having a desire to see the world, he had run away from his
friends, who were people of opulence at Madrid, and that he did
not intend to return until he had travelled through various
countries.&nbsp; I told him that if what he said was true, he had
done a very wicked and foolish action; wicked, because he must
have overwhelmed those with grief whom he was bound to honour and
love, and foolish, inasmuch as he was going to expose himself to
inconceivable miseries and hardships, which would shortly cause
him to rue the step he had taken; that he would be <a
name="page1_85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>only
welcome in foreign countries so long as he had money to spend,
and when he had none, he would be repulsed as a vagabond, and
would perhaps be allowed to perish of hunger.&nbsp; He replied
that he had a considerable sum of money with him, no less than a
hundred dollars, which would last him a long time, and that when
it was spent he should perhaps be able to obtain more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your hundred dollars,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will scarcely
last you three months in the country in which you are, even if it
be not stolen from you; and you may as well hope to gather money
on the tops of the mountains as expect to procure more by
honourable means.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had not yet sufficiently
drank of the cup of experience to attend much to what I said, and
I soon after changed the subject.&nbsp; About five next morning
he came to my bedside to take leave, as his muleteers were
preparing to depart.&nbsp; I gave him the usual Spanish
valediction, <i>Vaya usted con Dios</i>, <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a> and saw no more of him.</p>
<p>At nine, after having paid a most exorbitant sum for slight
accommodation, I started from Arroyolos, which is a town or large
village situated on very elevated ground, and discernible afar
off.&nbsp; It can boast of the remains of a large ancient and
seemingly Moorish castle, which stands on a hill on the left as
you take the road to Estremoz.</p>
<p>About a mile from Arroyolos I overtook a train of carts,
escorted by a number of Portuguese soldiers conveying stores and
ammunition into Spain.&nbsp; Six or seven of these soldiers
marched a considerable way in front; they were villanous-looking
ruffians, upon whose livid and ghastly countenances were written
murder, and all the other crimes which the Decalogue <a
name="page1_86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>forbids.&nbsp; As I passed by, one of them, with a
harsh, croaking voice, commenced cursing all foreigners.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is this Frenchman riding on
horseback&rdquo; (I was on a mule), &ldquo;with a man&rdquo; (the
idiot) &ldquo;to take care of him, and all because he is rich;
whilst I, who am a poor soldier, am obliged to tramp on
foot.&nbsp; I could find it in my heart to shoot him dead, for in
what respect is he better than I?&nbsp; But he is a foreigner,
and the devil helps foreigners and hates the
Portuguese.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued shouting his remarks until
I got about forty yards in advance, when I commenced laughing;
but it would have been more prudent in me to have held my peace,
for the next moment, with bang&mdash;bang, two bullets, well
aimed, came whizzing past my ears.&nbsp; A small river lay just
before me, though the bridge was a considerable way on my
left.&nbsp; I spurred my animal through it, closely followed by
the terrified guide, and commenced galloping along a sandy plain
on the other side, and so escaped with my life.</p>
<p>These fellows, with the look of banditti, were in no respect
better; and the traveller who should meet them in a solitary
place would have little reason to bless his good fortune.&nbsp;
One of the carriers (all of whom were Spaniards from the
neighbourhood of Badajoz, and had been despatched into Portugal
for the purpose of conveying the stores), whom I afterwards met
in the aforesaid town, informed me that the whole party were
equally bad, and that he and his companions had been plundered by
them of various articles, and threatened with death if they
attempted to complain.&nbsp; How frightful to figure to
one&rsquo;s self an army of such beings in a foreign land, sent
thither either to invade or defend; and yet Spain <a
name="page1_87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>at the time
I am writing this is looking forward to armed assistance from
Portugal!&nbsp; May the Lord in his mercy grant that the soldiers
who proceed to her assistance may be of a different stamp: and
yet, from the lax state of discipline which exists in the
Portuguese army, in comparison with that of England and France, I
am afraid that the inoffensive population of the disturbed
provinces will say that wolves have been summoned to chase away
foxes from the sheep-fold.&nbsp; Oh, may I live to see the day
when soldiery will no longer be tolerated in any civilized, or at
least Christian country!</p>
<p>I pursued my route to Estremoz, passing by Monte Moro Novo,
which is a tall dusky hill, surmounted by an ancient edifice,
probably Moorish.&nbsp; The country was dreary and deserted, but
offering here and there a valley studded with cork-trees and
<i>azinheiras</i>.&nbsp; After midday the wind, which during the
night and morning had much abated, again blew with such violence
as nearly to deprive me of my senses, though it was still in our
rear.</p>
<p>I was heartily glad when, on ascending a rising ground, at
about four o&rsquo;clock, I saw Estremoz on its hill at something
less than a league&rsquo;s distance.&nbsp; Here the view became
wildly interesting; the sun was sinking in the midst of red and
stormy clouds, and its rays were reflected on the dun walls of
the lofty town to which we were wending.&nbsp; Not far distant to
the south-west rose Serra Dorso, which I had seen from Evora, and
which is the most beautiful mountain in the Alemtejo.&nbsp; My
idiot guide turned his uncouth visage towards it, and, becoming
suddenly inspired, opened his mouth for the first time during the
day, I might almost say since we had left Aldea Gallega, <a
name="page1_88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>and began
to tell me what rare hunting was to be obtained in that
mountain.&nbsp; He likewise described with great minuteness a
wonderful dog, which was kept in the neighbourhood for the
purpose of catching the wolves and wild boars, and for which the
proprietor had refused twenty <i>moidores</i>.</p>
<p>At length we reached Estremoz, and took up our quarters at the
principal inn, which looks upon a large plain or market-place
occupying the centre of the town, and which is so extensive that
I should think ten thousand soldiers at least might perform their
evolutions there with ease.</p>
<p>The cold was far too terrible to permit me to remain in the
chamber to which I had been conducted; I therefore went down to a
kind of kitchen on one side of the arched passage, which led
under the house to the yard and stables.&nbsp; A tremendous
withering blast poured through this passage, like the water
through the flush of a mill.&nbsp; A large cork-tree was blazing
in the kitchen beneath a spacious chimney; and around it were
gathered a noisy crew of peasants and farmers from the
neighbourhood, and three or four Spanish smugglers from the
frontier.&nbsp; I with difficulty obtained a place amongst them,
as a Portuguese or a Spaniard will seldom make way for a
stranger, till called upon or pushed aside, but prefers gazing
upon him with an expression which seems to say, &ldquo;I know
what you want, but I prefer remaining where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now first began to observe an alteration in the language
spoken; it had become less sibilant, and more guttural; and, when
addressing each other, the speakers used the Spanish title of
courtesy <i>usted</i>, or your worthiness, instead of the
Portuguese high-flowing <a name="page1_89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span><i>vossem se</i>, <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> or your lordship.&nbsp; This is the
result of constant communication with the natives of Spain, who
never condescend to speak Portuguese, even when in Portugal, but
persist in the use of their own beautiful language, which,
perhaps, at some future period, the Portuguese will generally
adopt.&nbsp; This would greatly facilitate the union of the two
countries, hitherto kept asunder by the natural waywardness of
mankind.</p>
<p>I had not been seated long before the blazing pile, when a
fellow, mounted on a fine spirited horse, dashed from the stables
through the passage into the kitchen, where he commenced
displaying his horsemanship, by causing the animal to wheel about
with the velocity of a mill-stone, to the great danger of
everybody in the apartment.&nbsp; He then galloped out upon the
plain, and after half an hour&rsquo;s absence returned, and
having placed his horse once more in the stable, came and seated
himself next to me, to whom he commenced talking in a gibberish
of which I understood very little, but which he intended for
French.&nbsp; He was half intoxicated, and soon became three
parts so, by swallowing glass after glass of
<i>aguardiente</i>.&nbsp; Finding that I made him no answer, he
directed his discourse to one of the <i>contrabandistas</i>, to
whom he talked in bad Spanish.&nbsp; The latter either did not or
would not understand him; but at last, losing patience, called
him a drunkard, and told him to hold his tongue.&nbsp; The <a
name="page1_90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>fellow,
enraged at this contempt, flung the glass out of which he was
drinking at the Spaniard&rsquo;s head, who sprang up like a
tiger, and unsheathing instantly a &ldquo;snick and snee&rdquo;
knife, made an upward cut at the fellow&rsquo;s cheek, and would
have infallibly laid it open, had I not pulled his arm down just
in time to prevent worse effects than a scratch above the lower
jaw-bone, which, however, drew blood.</p>
<p>The smuggler&rsquo;s companions interfered, and with much
difficulty led him off to a small apartment in the rear of the
house, where they slept, and kept the furniture of their
mules.&nbsp; The drunkard then commenced singing, or rather
yelling, the <i>Marseillois</i> hymn; and after having annoyed
every one for nearly an hour, was persuaded to mount his horse
and depart, accompanied by one of his neighbours.&nbsp; He was a
pig merchant of the vicinity, but had formerly been a trooper in
the army of Napoleon, where, I suppose, like the drunken coachman
of Evora, he had picked up his French and his habits of
intoxication. <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a></p>
<p>From Estremoz to Elvas the distance is six leagues.&nbsp; I
started at nine next morning; the first part of the way lay
through an inclosed country, but we soon emerged upon wild bleak
downs, over which the wind, which still pursued us, howled most
mournfully.&nbsp; We met no one on the route; and the scene was
desolate in the extreme; the heaven was of a dark grey, through
which no glimpse of the sun was to be perceived.&nbsp; Before us,
at a great distance, on an elevated ground, rose a
tower&mdash;the only object which broke the monotony of the
waste.&nbsp; In about two hours from the time when we first
discovered it, we reached <a name="page1_91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>a fountain, at the foot of the hill
on which it stood; the water, which gushed into a long stone
trough, was beautifully clear and transparent, and we stopped
here to water the animals.</p>
<p>Having dismounted, I left the guide, and proceeded to ascend
the hill on which the tower stood.&nbsp; Though the ascent was
very gentle, I did not accomplish it without difficulty; the
ground was covered with sharp stones, which, in two or three
instances, cut through my boots and wounded my feet; and the
distance was much greater than I had expected.&nbsp; I at last
arrived at the ruin, for such it was.&nbsp; I found it had been
one of those watch-towers or small fortresses called in
Portuguese <i>atalaias</i>; it was square, and surrounded by a
wall, broken down in many places.&nbsp; The tower itself had no
door, the lower part being of solid stonework; but on one side
were crevices at intervals between the stones, for the purpose of
placing the feet, and up this rude staircase I climbed to a small
apartment, about five feet square, from which the top had
fallen.&nbsp; It commanded an extensive view from all sides, and
had evidently been built for the accommodation of those whose
business it was to keep watch on the frontier, and at the
appearance of an enemy to alarm the country by
signals&mdash;probably by a fire.&nbsp; Resolute men might have
defended themselves in this little fastness against many
assailants, who must have been completely exposed to their arrows
or musketry in the ascent.</p>
<p>Being about to leave the place, I heard a strange cry behind a
part of the wall which I had not visited, and hastening thither,
I found a miserable object in rags, seated upon a stone.&nbsp; It
was a maniac&mdash;a man about thirty years of age, and I believe
deaf and dumb; <a name="page1_92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>there he sat, gibbering and mowing, and distorting his
wild features into various dreadful appearances.&nbsp; There
wanted nothing but this object to render the scene complete;
banditti amongst such melancholy desolation would have been by no
means so much in keeping.&nbsp; But the maniac, on his stone, in
the rear of the wind-beaten ruin, overlooking the blasted heath,
above which scowled the leaden heaven, presented such a picture
of gloom and misery as I believe neither painter nor poet ever
conceived in the saddest of their musings.&nbsp; This is not the
first instance in which it has been my lot to verify the wisdom
of the saying, that truth is sometimes wilder than fiction.</p>
<p>I remounted my mule, and proceeded till, on the top of another
hill, my guide suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;There is
Elvas!&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked in the direction in which he
pointed, and beheld a town perched on the top of a lofty
hill.&nbsp; On the other side of a deep valley towards the left
rose another hill, much higher, on the top of which is the
celebrated fort of Elvas, believed to be the strongest place in
Portugal.&nbsp; Through the opening between the fort and the
town, but in the background and far in Spain, I discerned the
misty sides and cloudy head of a stately mountain, which I
afterwards learned was Albuquerque, one of the loftiest of
Estremadura.</p>
<p>We now got into a cultivated country, and following the road,
which wound amongst hedgerows, we arrived at a place where the
ground began gradually to shelve down.&nbsp; Here, on the right,
was the commencement of an aqueduct, by means of which the town
on the opposite hill was supplied; it was at this point scarcely
two feet in altitude, but, as we descended, it became higher and
higher, and its proportions more colossal.</p>
<p><a name="page1_93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Near
the bottom of the valley it took a turn to the left, bestriding
the road with one of its arches.&nbsp; I looked up, after passing
under it; the water must have been flowing near a hundred feet
above my head, and I was filled with wonder at the immensity of
the structure which conveyed it.&nbsp; There was, however, one
feature which was no slight drawback to its pretensions to
grandeur and magnificence: the water was supported not by
gigantic single arches, like those of the aqueduct of Lisbon,
which stalk over the valley like legs of Titans, but by three
layers of arches, which, like three distinct aqueducts, rise
above each other.&nbsp; The expense and labour necessary for the
erection of such a structure must have been enormous; and when we
reflect with what comparative ease modern art would confer the
same advantage, we cannot help congratulating ourselves that we
live in times when it is not necessary to exhaust the wealth of a
province to supply a town on a hill with one of the first
necessaries of existence.</p>
<h2><a name="page1_94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm">Elvas&mdash;Extraordinary Longevity&mdash;The
English Nation&mdash;Portuguese
Ingratitude&mdash;Illiberality&mdash;Fortifications&mdash;Spanish
Beggar&mdash;Badajoz&mdash;The Custom-House.</p>
<p>Arrived at the gate of Elvas, an officer came out of a kind of
guard-house, and, having asked me some questions, despatched a
soldier with me to the police-office, that my passport might be
<i>vis&eacute;</i>, as upon the frontier they are much more
particular with respect to passports than in other parts.&nbsp;
This matter having been settled, I entered an hostelry near the
same gate, which had been recommended to me by my host at Vendas
Novas, and which was kept by a person of the name of Joz&eacute;
Rosado.&nbsp; It was the best in the town, though, for
convenience and accommodation, inferior to a hedge alehouse in
England.&nbsp; The cold still pursued me, and I was glad to take
refuge in an inner kitchen, which, when the door was not open,
was only lighted by a fire burning somewhat dimly on the
hearth.&nbsp; An elderly female sat beside it in her chair,
telling her beads: there was something singular and extraordinary
in her look, as well as I could discern by the imperfect light of
the apartment.&nbsp; I put a few unimportant questions to her, to
which she replied, but seemed to be afflicted to a slight degree
<a name="page1_95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>with
deafness.&nbsp; Her hair was becoming grey, and I said that I
believed she was older than myself, but that I was confident she
had less snow on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old may you be, cavalier?&rdquo; said she, giving
me that title which in Spain is generally used when an
extraordinary degree of respect is wished to be exhibited.&nbsp;
I answered that I was near thirty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;you were right in supposing that I am older than
yourself; I am older than your mother, or your mother&rsquo;s
mother: it is more than a hundred years since I was a girl, and
sported with the daughters of the town on the
hillside.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you doubtless remember the earthquake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if there is any occurrence
in my life that I remember, it is that: I was in the church of
Elvas at the moment, hearing the Mass of the king, and the priest
fell on the ground, and let fall the Host from his hands.&nbsp; I
shall never forget how the earth shook; it made us all sick; and
the houses and walls reeled like drunkards.&nbsp; Since that
happened I have seen fourscore years pass by me, yet I was older
then than you are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked with wonder at this surprising female, and could
scarcely believe her words.&nbsp; I was, however, assured that
she was in fact upwards of a hundred and ten years of age, and
was considered the oldest person in Portugal.&nbsp; She still
retained the use of her faculties in as full a degree as the
generality of people who have scarcely attained the half of her
age.&nbsp; She was related to the people of the house.</p>
<p>As the night advanced, several persons entered for the purpose
of enjoying the comfort of the fire, and for the sake of
conversation, for the house was a kind of news-room, where the
principal speaker was <a name="page1_96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the host, a man of some shrewdness
and experience, who had served as a soldier in the British
army.&nbsp; Amongst others was the officer who commanded at the
gate.&nbsp; After a few observations, this gentleman, who was a
good-looking young man of five and twenty, began to burst forth
in violent declamation against the English nation and government,
who, he said, had at all times proved themselves selfish and
deceitful, but that their present conduct in respect to Spain was
particularly infamous, for though it was in their power to put an
end to the war at once, by sending a large army thither, they
preferred sending a handful of troops, in order that the war
might be prolonged, for no other reason than that it was of
advantage to them.&nbsp; Having paid him an ironical compliment
for his politeness and urbanity, I asked whether he reckoned
amongst the selfish actions of the English government and nation,
their having expended hundreds of millions of pounds sterling,
and an ocean of precious blood, in fighting the battles of Spain
and Portugal against Napoleon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;the fort of Elvas above our heads, and still more the
castle of Badajoz <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> over the water, speak volumes
respecting English selfishness, and must, every time you view
them, confirm you in the opinion which you have just
expressed.&nbsp; And then, with respect to <a
name="page1_97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the present
combat in Spain, the gratitude which that country evinced to
England after the French, by means of English armies, had been
expelled,&mdash;gratitude evinced by discouraging the trade of
England on all occasions, and by offering up masses in
thanksgiving when the English heretics quitted the Spanish
shores, ought now to induce England to exhaust and ruin herself,
for the sake of hunting Don Carlos out of his mountains.&nbsp; In
deference to your superior judgment,&rdquo; continued I to the
officer, &ldquo;I will endeavour to believe that it would be for
the advantage of England were the war prolonged for an indefinite
period; nevertheless, you would do me a particular favour by
explaining by what process in chemistry blood shed in Spain will
find its way into the English treasury in the shape of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was not ready with his answer, I took up a plate of
fruit which stood on the table beside me, and said, &ldquo;What
do you call these fruits?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pomegranates and
<i>bolotas</i>,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;a homebred Englishman could not have given me that
answer; yet he is as much acquainted with pomegranates and
<i>bolotas</i> as your lordship is with the line of conduct which
it is incumbent upon England to pursue in her foreign and
domestic policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer of mine, I confess, was not that of a Christian,
and proved to me how much of the leaven of the ancient man still
pervaded me; yet I must be permitted to add that I believe no
other provocation would have elicited from me a reply so full of
angry feeling: but I could not command myself when I heard my own
glorious land traduced in this unmerited manner.&nbsp; By
whom?&nbsp; A Portuguese!&nbsp; A native of a country which has
been twice liberated from horrid <a name="page1_98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>and detestable thraldom by the hands
of Englishmen.&nbsp; But for Wellington and his heroes, Portugal
would have been French at this day; but for Napier and his
marines, Miguel would now be lording it in Lisbon.&nbsp; To
return, however, to the officer: every one laughed at him, and he
presently went away.</p>
<p>The next day I became acquainted with a respectable tradesman,
of the name of Almeida, a man of talent, though rather rough in
his manners.&nbsp; He expressed great abhorrence of the papal
system, which had so long spread a darkness, like that of death,
over his unfortunate country; and I had no sooner informed him
that I had brought with me a certain quantity of Testaments,
which it was my intention to leave for sale at Elvas, than he
expressed a great desire to undertake the charge, and said that
he would do the utmost in his power to procure a sale for them
amongst his numerous customers.&nbsp; Upon showing him a copy, I
remarked, &ldquo;Your name is upon the title-page;&rdquo; the
Portuguese version of the Holy Scriptures, <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a> circulated by the Bible Society, having
been executed by a Protestant, of the name of Almeida, and first
published in the year 1712; whereupon he smiled, and observed
that he esteemed it an honour to be connected in name at least
with such a man.&nbsp; He <a name="page1_99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>scoffed at the idea of receiving any
remuneration, and assured me that the feeling of being permitted
to co-operate in so holy and useful a cause as the circulation of
the Scriptures was quite a sufficient reward.</p>
<p>After having accomplished this matter, I proceeded to survey
the environs of the place, and strolled up the hill to the fort
on the north side of the town.&nbsp; The lower part of the hill
is planted with <i>azinheiras</i>, which give it a picturesque
appearance, and at the bottom is a small brook, which I crossed
by means of stepping-stones.&nbsp; Arrived at the gate of the
fort, I was stopped by the sentry, who, however, civilly told me
that if I sent in my name to the commanding officer, he would
make no objection to my visiting the interior.&nbsp; I
accordingly sent in my card by a soldier who was lounging about,
and, sitting down on a stone, waited his return.&nbsp; He
presently appeared, and inquired whether I was an Englishman; to
which having replied in the affirmative, he said, &ldquo;In that
case, sir, you cannot enter; indeed, it is not the custom to
permit any foreigners to visit the fort.&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered
that it was perfectly indifferent to me whether I visited it or
not; and, having taken a survey of Badajoz from the eastern side
of the hill, descended by the way I came.</p>
<p>This is one of the beneficial results of protecting a nation,
and squandering blood and treasure in its defence.&nbsp; The
English, who have never been at war with Portugal, who have
fought for its independence on land and sea, and always with
success, who have forced themselves, by a treaty of commerce, <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a> to drink <a name="page1_100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>its coarse and filthy wines, which
no other nation cares to taste, are the most unpopular people who
visit Portugal.&nbsp; The French have ravaged the country with
fire and sword, and shed the blood of its sons like water; the
French buy not its fruits, and loathe its wines, yet there is no
bad spirit in Portugal towards the French.&nbsp; The reason of
this is no mystery; it is the nature not of the Portuguese only,
but of corrupt and unregenerate man, to dislike his benefactors,
who, by conferring benefits upon him, mortify in the most
generous manner his miserable vanity.</p>
<p>There is no country in which the English are so popular as in
France; <a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a> but, though the French have been
frequently roughly handled by the English, and have seen their
capital occupied by an English army, they have never been
subjected to the supposed ignominy of receiving assistance from
them.</p>
<p>The fortifications of Elvas are models of their kind, and, at
the first view, it would seem that the town, if well garrisoned,
might bid defiance to any hostile power; but it has its weak
point: the western side is commanded by a hill, at the distance
of half a mile, from which an experienced general would cannonade
it, and probably with success.&nbsp; It is the last town in this
part of Portugal, the distance to the Spanish frontier being
barely two leagues.&nbsp; It was evidently built as a rival to
Badajoz, upon which it looks down from its height across a sandy
plain and over the <a name="page1_101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>sullen waters of the Guadiana; but,
though a strong town, it can scarcely be called a defence to the
frontier, which is open on all sides, so that there would not be
the slightest necessity for an invading army to approach within a
dozen leagues of its walls, should it be disposed to avoid
them.&nbsp; Its fortifications are so extensive that ten thousand
men at least would be required to man them, who, in the event of
an invasion, might be far better employed in meeting the enemy in
the open field.&nbsp; The French, during their occupation of
Portugal, kept a small force in this place, who, at the approach
of the British, retreated to the fort, where they shortly after
capitulated.</p>
<p>Having nothing farther to detain me at Elvas, I proceeded to
cross the frontier into Spain.&nbsp; My idiot guide was on his
way back to Aldea Gallega; and, on the fifth of January, I
mounted a sorry mule, without bridle or stirrups, which I guided
by a species of halter, and followed by a lad who was to attend
me on another, I spurred down the hill of Elvas to the plain,
eager to arrive in old chivalrous, romantic Spain.&nbsp; But I
soon found that I had no need to quicken the beast which bore me,
for, though covered with sores, wall-eyed, and with a kind of
halt in its gait, it cantered along like the wind.</p>
<p>In little more than half an hour we arrived at a brook, whose
waters ran vigorously between steep banks.&nbsp; A man who was
standing on the side directed me to the ford in the squeaking
dialect of Portugal; but whilst I was yet splashing through the
water, a voice from the other bank hailed me, in the magnificent
language of Spain, in this guise: &ldquo;<i>O</i>!
<i>Se&ntilde;or Caballero</i>, <i>que me d&eacute; usted una
limosna por amor de Dios</i>, <i>una limosnita para que yo me
compre un traguillo </i><a name="page1_102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span><i>de vino tinto</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a>&nbsp; In a moment I was on Spanish
ground, as the brook, which is called Acaia, is the boundary here
of the two kingdoms, and, having flung the beggar a small piece
of silver, I cried in ecstasy, &ldquo;<i>Santiago y cierra
Espa&ntilde;a</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a> and scoured on
my way with more speed than before, paying, as Gil Blas says,
little heed to the torrent of blessings which the mendicant
poured forth in my rear: <a name="citation102c"></a><a
href="#footnote102c" class="citation">[102c]</a> yet never was
charity more unwisely bestowed, for I was subsequently informed
that the fellow was a confirmed drunkard, who took his station
every morning at the ford, where he remained the whole day for
the purpose of extorting money from the passengers, which he
regularly spent every night in the wine-shops of Badajoz.&nbsp;
To those who gave him money he returned blessings, and to those
who refused, curses; being equally skilled and fluent in the use
of either.</p>
<p>Badajoz was now in view, at the distance of little more than
half a league.&nbsp; We soon took a turn to the left, towards a
bridge of many arches across the Guadiana, which, though so famed
in song and ballad, is a very unpicturesque stream, shallow and
sluggish, though tolerably wide; its banks were white with linen
which the washerwomen had spread out to dry in the sun, which was
shining brightly; I heard their singing at a great distance, and
the theme seemed to be the praises of the river where they were
toiling, for <a name="page1_103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>as I approached I could distinguish &ldquo;Guadiana,
Guadiana,&rdquo; which reverberated far and wide, pronounced by
the clear and strong voices in chorus of many a dark-cheeked maid
and matron.&nbsp; I thought there was some analogy between their
employment and my own: I was about to tan my northern complexion
by exposing myself to the hot sun of Spain, in the humble hope of
being able to cleanse some of the foul stains of Popery from the
minds of its children, with whom I had little acquaintance;
whilst they were bronzing themselves on the banks of the river in
order to make white the garments of strangers.&nbsp; The words of
an Eastern poet returned forcibly to my mind&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll weary myself each night and each
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To aid my unfortunate brothers;<br />
As the laundress tans her own face in the ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To cleanse the garments of others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having crossed the bridge, <a name="citation103a"></a><a
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a> we arrived at
the northern gate, when out rushed from a species of sentry-box a
fellow wearing on his head a high-peaked Andalusian hat, with his
figure wrapped up in one of these immense cloaks <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a> so well known to those who have
travelled in Spain, and which none but a Spaniard can wear in a
becoming manner.&nbsp; Without saying a word, he laid hold of the
halter of the mule, and began to lead it through the gate up a
dirty street, crowded with long-cloaked people like
himself.&nbsp; I asked him what he meant, but he deigned not to
return an answer; the boy, however, who waited upon me, said <a
name="page1_104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>that it
was one of the gate-keepers, and that he was conducting us to the
custom-house or <i>Alfandega</i>, where the baggage would be
examined.&nbsp; Having arrived there, the fellow, who still
maintained a dogged silence, began to pull the trunks off the
sumpter-mule, and commenced uncording them.&nbsp; I was about to
give him a severe reproof for his brutality; but before I could
open my mouth a stout elderly personage appeared at the door, who
I soon found was the principal officer.&nbsp; He looked at me for
a moment, and then asked me, in the English language, if I was an
Englishman.&nbsp; On my replying in the affirmative, he demanded
of the fellow how he dared to have the insolence to touch the
baggage without orders, and sternly bade him cord up the trunks
again and place them on the mule, which he performed without
uttering a word.&nbsp; The gentleman then asked what the trunks
contained: I answered clothes and linen; when he begged pardon
for the insolence of the subordinate, and informed me that I was
at liberty to proceed where I thought proper.&nbsp; I thanked him
for his exceeding politeness; and, under guidance of the boy,
made the best of my way to the Inn of the Three Nations, <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> to which I had been recommended at
Elvas.</p>

Badajoz&mdash;The Gypsy Donkey&mdash;Merida&mdash;The Ruined
Wall&mdash;The Crone&mdash;The Land of the Moor&mdash;The Black
Men&mdash;Life in the Desert&mdash;The Supper.</p>
<p>I was now at Badajoz in Spain, a country which for the next
four years was destined to be the scene of my labours: but I will
not anticipate.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of Badajoz did not
prepossess me much in favour of the country which I had just
entered.&nbsp; It consists chiefly of brown moors, which bear
little but a species of brushwood, called in Spanish
<i>carrasco</i>; blue mountains are, however, seen towering up in
the far distance, which relieve the scene from the monotony which
would otherwise pervade it.</p>
<p>It was at this town of Badajoz, the capital of Estremadura,
that I first fell in with those singular people, the
<i>Zincali</i>, <i>Gitanos</i>, or Spanish gypsies.&nbsp; It was
here I met with the wild Paco, <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a> the man with the
withered arm, who wielded the <i>cachas</i> <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a> with his left hand; his shrewd wife,
Antonia, skilled in <i>hokkano </i><a name="page1_106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span><i>baro</i>, or the great trick <a
name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a>; the fierce gypsy, Antonio Lopez,
their father-in-law; and many other almost equally singular
individuals of the <i>Errate</i>, or gypsy blood.&nbsp; It was
here that I first preached the gospel to the gypsy people, and
commenced that translation of the New Testament in the Spanish
gypsy tongue, a portion of which I subsequently printed at
Madrid.</p>
<p>After a stay of three weeks at Badajoz, I prepared to depart
for Madrid: late one afternoon, as I was arranging my scanty
baggage, the gypsy Antonio entered my apartment, dressed in his
<i>zamarra</i> and high-peaked Andalusian hat.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Good evening, brother; they tell me that
on the <i>callicaste</i> you intend to set out for
<i>Madrilati</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Such is my intention; I can stay here no
longer.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;The way is far to <i>Madrilati</i>,
there are, moreover, wars in the land, and many <i>chories</i>
walk about; are you not afraid to journey?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I have no fears; every man must
accomplish his destiny: what befalls my body or soul was written
in a <i>gabicote</i> a thousand years before the foundation of
the world.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;I have no fears myself, brother; the
dark night is the same to me as the fair day, and the wild
<i>carrascal</i> as the market-place or the <i>chard&iacute;</i>;
I have got the <i>bar lach&iacute;</i> in my bosom, the precious
stone to which sticks the needle. <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a></p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You mean the loadstone, I suppose.&nbsp;
Do you believe that a lifeless stone can preserve you from the
dangers which occasionally threaten your life?</p>
<p><a name="page1_107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Brother, I am fifty years old,
and you see me standing before you in life and strength; how
could that be unless the <i>bar lach&iacute;</i> had power?&nbsp;
I have been soldier and <i>contrabandista</i>, and I have
likewise slain and robbed the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; The
bullets of the <i>Gabin&eacute;</i> and of the <i>jara
canallis</i> have hissed about my ears without injuring me, for I
carried the <i>bar lach&iacute;</i>.&nbsp; I have twenty times
done that which by <i>Busn&eacute;</i> law should have brought me
to the <i>filimicha</i>, yet my neck has never yet been squeezed
by the cold <i>garrote</i>.&nbsp; Brother, I trust in the <i>bar
lach&iacute;</i>, like the <i>Calor&eacute;</i> of old: were I in
the midst of the gulph of <i>Bombard&oacute;</i> without a plank
to float upon, I should feel no fear; for if I carried the
precious stone, it would bring me safe to shore.&nbsp; The <i>bar
lach&iacute;</i> has power, brother.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I shall not dispute the matter with you,
more especially as I am about to depart from Badajoz: I must
speedily bid you farewell, and we shall see each other no
more.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Brother, do you know what brings me
hither?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I cannot tell, unless it be to wish me a
happy journey: I am not gypsy enough to interpret the thoughts of
other people.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;All last night I lay awake, thinking of
the affairs of Egypt; and when I arose in the morning I took the
<i>bar lach&iacute;</i> from my bosom, and scraping it with a
knife, swallowed some of the dust in <i>aguardiente</i>, as I am
in the habit of doing when I have made up my mind; and I said to
myself, I am wanted on the frontiers of <i>Castumba</i> on a
certain matter.&nbsp; The strange <i>Calor&oacute;</i> is about
to proceed to <i>Madrilati</i>; the journey is long, and he <a
name="page1_108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>may fall
into evil hands, peradventure into those of his own blood; for
let me tell you, brother, the <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> are leaving
their towns and villages, and forming themselves into troops to
plunder the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>, for there is now but little law
in the land, and now or never is the time for the
<i>Calor&eacute;</i> to become once more what they were in former
times.&nbsp; So I said, the strange <i>Calor&oacute;</i> may fall
into the hands of his own blood and be ill-treated by them, which
were shame: I will therefore go with him through the <i>Chim del
Manr&oacute;</i> as far as the frontiers of <i>Castumba</i>, and
upon the frontiers of <i>Castumba</i> I will leave the London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i> to find his own way to <i>Madrilati</i>, for
there is less danger in <i>Castumba</i> than in the <i>Chim del
Manr&oacute;</i>, and I will then betake me to the affairs of
Egypt which call me from hence.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;This is a very hopeful plan of yours, my
friend; and in what manner do you propose that we shall
travel?</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;I will tell you, brother.&nbsp; I have a
<i>gras</i> in the stall, even the one which I purchased at
Oliven&ccedil;as, as I told you on a former occasion; <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a> it is good and fleet, and cost me, who
am a gypsy, fifty <i>chul&eacute;</i>; upon that <i>gras</i> you
shall ride.&nbsp; As for myself, I will journey upon the
<i>macho</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Before I answer you, I shall wish you to
inform me what business it is which renders your presence
necessary in <i>Castumba</i>; your son-in-law, Paco, told me that
it was no longer the custom of the gypsies to wander.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;It is an affair of Egypt, brother, and I
shall not acquaint you with it; peradventure it relates to a
horse or an ass, or peradventure it relates to a <a
name="page1_109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>mule or a
<i>macho</i>; it does not relate to yourself, therefore I advise
you not to inquire about it&mdash;<i>Dosta</i>.&nbsp; With
respect to my offer, you are free to decline it; there is a
<i>drungruje</i> between here and <i>Madrilati</i>, and you can
travel it in the <i>birdoche</i>, or with the
<i>drom&aacute;lis</i>; but I tell you, as a brother, that there
are <i>chories</i> upon the <i>drun</i>, and some of them are of
the <i>Errate</i>.</p>
<p>Certainly few people in my situation would have accepted the
offer of this singular gypsy.&nbsp; It was not, however, without
its allurements for me; I was fond of adventure, and what more
ready means of gratifying my love of it than by putting myself
under the hands of such a guide?&nbsp; There are many who would
have been afraid of treachery, but I had no fears on this point,
as I did not believe that the fellow harboured the slightest ill
intention towards me; I saw that he was fully convinced that I
was one of the <i>Errate</i>, and his affection for his own race,
and his hatred for the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>, were his strongest
characteristics.&nbsp; I wished, moreover, to lay hold of every
opportunity of making myself acquainted with the ways of the
Spanish gypsies, and an excellent one here presented itself on my
first entrance into Spain.&nbsp; In a word, I determined to
accompany the gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; I
exclaimed; &ldquo;as for my baggage, I will despatch it to Madrid
by the <i>birdoche</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do so,
brother,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and the <i>gras</i> will go
lighter.&nbsp; Baggage, indeed!&mdash;what need of baggage have
you?&nbsp; How the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> on the road would laugh if
they saw two <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> with baggage behind
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During my stay at Badajoz I had but little intercourse with
the Spaniards, my time being chiefly devoted to the gypsies, with
whom, from long intercourse with various sections of their race
in different <a name="page1_110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>parts of the world, I felt myself much more at home
than with the silent, reserved men of Spain, with whom a
foreigner might mingle for half a century without having half a
dozen words addressed to him, unless he himself made the first
advances to intimacy, which, after all, might be rejected with a
shrug and a <i>no entiendo</i>; <a name="citation110"></a><a
href="#footnote110" class="citation">[110]</a> for among the many
deeply-rooted prejudices of these people is the strange idea that
no foreigner can speak their language, an idea to which they will
still cling though they hear him conversing with perfect ease;
for in that case the utmost that they will concede to his
attainments is, <i>Habla quatro palabras y nada mas</i> (he can
speak four words, and no more).</p>
<p>Early one morning, before sunrise, I found myself at the house
of Antonio; it was a small mean building, situated in a dirty
street.&nbsp; The morning was quite dark; the street, however,
was partially illumined by a heap of lighted straw, round which
two or three men were busily engaged, apparently holding an
object over the flames.&nbsp; Presently the gypsy&rsquo;s door
opened, and Antonio made his appearance; and, casting his eye in
the direction of the light, exclaimed, &ldquo;The swine have
killed their brother; would that every <i>Busn&oacute;</i> was
served as yonder hog is.&nbsp; Come in, brother, and we will eat
the heart of that hog.&rdquo;&nbsp; I scarcely understood his
words, but following him, he led me into a low room, in which was
a <i>brasero</i>, or small pan full of lighted charcoal; beside
it was a rude table, spread with a coarse linen cloth, upon which
was bread and a large pipkin full of a mess which emitted no
disagreeable savour.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heart of the
<i>balich&oacute;</i> is in that <i>puchera</i>,&rdquo; said
Antonio; &ldquo;eat, brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; We <a
name="page1_111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>both sat
down and ate&mdash;Antonio voraciously.&nbsp; When we had
concluded he arose:&mdash;&ldquo;Have you got your
<i>li</i>?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo;
said I, showing him my passport.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;you may want it.&nbsp; I want none; my passport is the
<i>bar lach&iacute;</i>.&nbsp; Now for a glass of
<i>repa&ntilde;i</i>, and then for the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We left the room, the door of which he locked, hiding the key
beneath a loose brick in a corner of the passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
into the street, brother, whilst I fetch the <i>caballerias</i>
from the stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; I obeyed him.&nbsp; The sun had not
yet risen, and the air was piercingly cold; the grey light,
however, of dawn enabled me to distinguish objects with tolerable
accuracy; I soon heard the clattering of the animals&rsquo; feet,
and Antonio presently stepped forth, leading the horse by the
bridle; the <i>macho</i> followed behind.&nbsp; I looked at the
horse, and shrugged my shoulders.&nbsp; As far as I could scan
it, it appeared the most uncouth animal I had ever beheld.&nbsp;
It was of a spectral white, short in the body, but with
remarkably long legs.&nbsp; I observed that it was particularly
high in the <i>cruz</i>, or withers.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are looking
at the <i>grasti</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio; &ldquo;it is eighteen
years old, but it is the very best in the <i>Chim del
Manr&oacute;</i>; I have long had my eye upon it; I bought it for
my own use for the affairs of Egypt.&nbsp; Mount, brother, mount,
and let us leave the <i>foros</i>&mdash;the gate is about being
opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He locked the door, and deposited the key in his
<i>faja</i>.&nbsp; In less than a quarter of an hour we had left
the town behind us.&nbsp; &ldquo;This does not appear to be a
very good horse,&rdquo; said I to Antonio, as we proceeded over
the plain; &ldquo;it is with difficulty that I can make him
move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the swiftest horse in the <i>Chim del
Manr&oacute;</i>, <a name="page1_112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>brother,&rdquo; said Antonio;
&ldquo;at the gallop, and at the speedy trot, there is no one to
match him.&nbsp; But he is eighteen years old, and his joints are
stiff, especially of a morning; but let him once become heated,
and the <i>genio del viejo</i> <a name="citation112"></a><a
href="#footnote112" class="citation">[112]</a> comes upon him,
and there is no holding him in with bit or bridle.&nbsp; I bought
that horse for the affairs of Egypt, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About noon we arrived at a small village in the neighbourhood
of a high lumpy hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no <i>Cal&oacute;</i>
house in this place,&rdquo; said Antonio; &ldquo;we will
therefore go to the posada of the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> and refresh
ourselves, man and beast.&rdquo;&nbsp; We entered the kitchen,
and sat down at the board, calling for wine and bread.&nbsp;
There were two ill-looking fellows in the kitchen, smoking
cigars.&nbsp; I said something to Antonio in the
<i>Cal&oacute;</i> language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that I hear?&rdquo; said one of the fellows,
who was distinguished by an immense pair of moustaches.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is that I hear?&nbsp; Is it in <i>Cal&oacute;</i>
that you are speaking before me, and I a <i>chalan</i> and
national?&nbsp; Accursed gypsy, how dare you enter this posada
and speak before me in that speech?&nbsp; Is it not forbidden by
the law of the land in which we are, even as it is forbidden for
a gypsy to enter the <i>mercado</i>?&nbsp; I tell you what,
friend, if I hear another word of <i>Cal&oacute;</i> come from
your mouth, I will cudgel your bones and send you flying over the
house-tops with a kick of my foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would do right,&rdquo; said his companion;
&ldquo;the insolence of these gypsies is no longer to be
borne.&nbsp; When I am at Merida or Badajoz I go to the
<i>mercado</i>, and there in a corner stand the accursed gypsies,
jabbering to each other in a speech which I understand not.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gypsy gentleman,&rsquo; say I to one of them, &lsquo;what
<a name="page1_113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>will
you have for that donkey?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will have ten
dollars for it, <i>Caballero nacional</i>,&rsquo; says the gypsy;
&lsquo;it is the best donkey in all Spain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should like to see its paces,&rsquo; say I.&nbsp; &lsquo;That you
shall, most valorous!&rsquo; says the gypsy, and jumping upon its
back, he puts it to its paces, first of all whispering something
into its ear in <i>Cal&oacute;</i>, and truly the paces of the
donkey are most wonderful, such as I have never seen
before.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think it will just suit me;&rsquo; and,
after looking at it awhile, I take out the money and pay for
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall go to my house,&rsquo; says the gypsy;
and off he runs.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall go to my village,&rsquo;
say I, and I mount the donkey.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Vamonos</i>,&rsquo; say I, but the donkey won&rsquo;t
move.&nbsp; I give him a switch, but I don&rsquo;t get on the
better for that.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; say I, and I
fall to spurring him.&nbsp; What happens then, brother?&nbsp; The
wizard no sooner feels the prick than he bucks down, and flings
me over his head into the mire.&nbsp; I get up and look about me;
there stands the donkey staring at me, and there stand the whole
gypsy <i>canaille</i> squinting at me with their filmy
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the scamp who has sold me this piece
of furniture?&rsquo; I shout.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is gone to Granada,
valorous,&rsquo; says one.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is gone to see his
kindred among the Moors,&rsquo; says another.&nbsp; &lsquo;I just
saw him running over the field, in the direction of ---, with the
devil close behind him,&rsquo; says a third.&nbsp; In a word I am
tricked.&nbsp; I wish to dispose of the donkey; no one, however,
will buy him; he is a <i>Cal&oacute;</i> donkey, and every person
avoids him.&nbsp; At last the gypsies offer thirty <i>reals</i>
for him; and after much chaffering I am glad to get rid of him at
two dollars.&nbsp; It is all a trick, however; he returns to his
master, and the brotherhood share the spoil amongst them, all
which villany would be prevented, <a name="page1_114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in my opinion, were the
<i>Cal&oacute;</i> language not spoken; for what but the word of
<i>Cal&oacute;</i> could have induced the donkey to behave in
such an unaccountable manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both seemed perfectly satisfied with the justness of this
conclusion, and continued smoking till their cigars were burnt to
stumps, when they arose, twitched their whiskers, looked at us
with fierce disdain, and dashing the tobacco-ends to the ground,
strode out of the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people seem no friends to the gypsies,&rdquo;
said I to Antonio, when the two bullies had departed, &ldquo;nor
to the <i>Cal&oacute;</i> language either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May evil glanders seize their nostrils,&rdquo; said
Antonio; &ldquo;they have been <i>jonjabadoed</i> <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> by our people.&nbsp; However,
brother, you did wrong to speak to me in <i>Cal&oacute;</i>, in a
<i>posada</i> like this; it is a forbidden language; for, as I
have often told you, the king has destroyed the law of the
<i>Cal&eacute;s</i>. <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a>&nbsp; Let us
away, brother, or those <i>juntunes</i> may set the
<i>justicia</i> upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards evening we drew near to a large town or village.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is Merida,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;formerly, as
the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> say, a mighty city of the
<i>Corahai</i>.&nbsp; We shall stay here to-night, and perhaps
for a day or two, for I have some business of Egypt to transact
in this place.&nbsp; Now, brother, step aside with the horse, and
wait for me beneath yonder wall.&nbsp; I must go before and see
in what condition matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dismounted from the horse, and sat down on a stone beneath
the ruined wall to which Antonio had motioned me.&nbsp; The sun
went down, and the air was exceedingly keen; I drew close around
me an old <a name="page1_115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>tattered gypsy cloak with which my companion had
provided me, and, being somewhat fatigued, fell into a doze which
lasted for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your worship the London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>?&rdquo;
said a strange voice close beside me.</p>
<p>I started, and beheld the face of a woman peering under my
hat.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the dusk, I could see that the
features were hideously ugly and almost black; they belonged, in
fact, to a gypsy crone, at least seventy years of age, leaning
upon a staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your worship the London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>?&rdquo;
repeated she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am he whom you seek,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where is
Antonio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Curelando</i>, <i>curelando</i>; <i>baribustres
curel&oacute;s terela</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation115"></a><a
href="#footnote115" class="citation">[115]</a> said the
crone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come with me, <i>Calor&oacute;</i> of my
<i>garlochin</i>, come with me to my little <i>ker</i>; he will
be there anon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed the crone, who led the way into the town, which was
ruinous and seemingly half deserted; we went up the street, from
which she turned into a narrow and dark lane, and presently
opened the gate of a large dilapidated house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>gras</i>?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the <i>gras</i> in too, my <i>chab&oacute;</i>,
bring the <i>gras</i> in too; there is room for the <i>gras</i>
in my little stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; We entered a large court,
across which we proceeded till we came to a wide doorway.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go in, my child of Egypt,&rdquo; said the
hag&mdash;&ldquo;go in; that is my little stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is as dark as pitch,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and may be a well for what I know: bring a light, or I
will not enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the <i>solabarri</i>,&rdquo; said the hag,
&ldquo;and I <a name="page1_116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>will lead your horse in, my <i>chab&oacute;</i> of
Egypt&mdash;yes, and tether him to my little manger.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She led the horse through the doorway, and I heard her busy in
the darkness; presently the horse shook himself: &ldquo;<i>Grasti
terelamos</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation116"></a><a
href="#footnote116" class="citation">[116]</a> said the hag, who
now made her appearance with the bridle in her hand; &ldquo;the
horse has shaken himself, he is not harmed by his day&rsquo;s
journey; now let us go in, my <i>Calor&oacute;</i>, into my
little room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered the house, and found ourselves in a vast room,
which would have been quite dark but for a faint glow which
appeared at the farther end: it proceeded from a <i>brasero</i>,
beside which were squatted two dusky figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are <i>Callees</i>,&rdquo; said the hag;
&ldquo;one is my daughter, and the other is her
<i>chab&iacute;</i>.&nbsp; Sit down, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>, and let us hear you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked about for a chair, but could see none; at a short
distance, however, I perceived the end of a broken pillar lying
on the floor; this I rolled to the <i>brasero</i>, and sat down
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine house, mother of the gypsies,&rdquo;
said I to the hag, willing to gratify the desire she had
expressed of hearing me speak; &ldquo;a fine house is this of
yours, rather cold and damp, though; it appears large enough to
be a barrack for <i>hundunares</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of houses in this <i>foros</i>, plenty of houses
in Merida, my London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>, some of them just as
they were left by the <i>Corahan&oacute;s</i>.&nbsp; Ah! a fine
people are the <i>Corahan&oacute;s</i>; I often wish myself in
their <i>chim</i> once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this, mother?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have you
been in the land of the Moors?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&ldquo;Twice have I been in their country, my
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>&mdash;twice have I been in the land of the
<i>Corahai</i>.&nbsp; The first time is more than fifty years
ago; I was then with the <i>Ses&eacute;</i>, for my husband was a
soldier of the <i>Crallis</i> of Spain, and Oran at that time
belonged to Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not then with the real Moors,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but only with the Spaniards who occupied part of their
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been with the real Moors, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>.&nbsp; Who knows more of the real Moors than
myself?&nbsp; About forty years ago I was with my <i>ro</i> in
Ceuta, for he was still a soldier of the king, and he said to me
one day, &lsquo;I am tired of this place, where there is no bread
and less water; I will escape and turn <i>Corahan&oacute;</i>;
this night I will kill my sergeant, and flee to the camp of the
Moor.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do so,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my
<i>chab&oacute;</i>, and as soon as may be I will follow you and
become a <i>Corahan&iacute;</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; That same night he
killed his sergeant, who five years before had called him
<i>Cal&oacute;</i> and cursed him; then running to the wall he
dropped from it, and, amidst many shots, he escaped to the land
of the <i>Corahai</i>.&nbsp; As for myself, I remained in the
<i>presidio</i> of Ceuta as a suttler, selling wine and
<i>repa&ntilde;i</i> to the soldiers.&nbsp; Two years passed by,
and I neither saw nor heard from my <i>ro</i>.&nbsp; One day
there came a strange man to my <i>cachimani</i>; he was dressed
like a <i>Corahan&oacute;</i>, and yet he did not look like one;
he looked more like a <i>callard&oacute;</i>, and yet he was not
a <i>callard&oacute;</i> either, though he was almost black; and
as I looked upon him, I thought he looked something like the
<i>Errate</i>; and he said to me, &lsquo;<i>Zincali</i>;
<i>chachip&eacute;</i>!&rsquo; and then he whispered to me in
queer language, which I could scarcely <a
name="page1_118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>understand, &lsquo;Your <i>ro</i> is waiting; come with
me, my little sister, and I will take you unto him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; said I, and he pointed to the west, to
the land of the <i>Corahai</i>, and said, &lsquo;He is yonder
away; come with me, little sister, the <i>ro</i> is
waiting.&rsquo;&nbsp; For a moment I was afraid, but I bethought
me of my husband, and I wished to be amongst the <i>Corahai</i>;
so I took the little <i>parn&eacute;</i> I had, and, locking up
the <i>cachimani</i>, went with the strange man.&nbsp; The
sentinel challenged us at the gate, but I gave him
<i>repa&ntilde;i</i>, and he let us pass; in a moment we were in
the land of the <i>Corahai</i>.&nbsp; About a league from the
town, beneath a hill, we found four people, men and women, all
very black like the strange man, and we joined ourselves with
them, and they all saluted me and called me little sister.&nbsp;
That was all I understood of their discourse, which was very
crabbed; and they took away my dress, and gave me other clothes,
and I looked like a <i>Corahan&iacute;</i>, and away we marched
for many days amidst deserts and small villages, and more than
once it seemed to me that I was amongst the <i>Errate</i>, for
their ways were the same.&nbsp; The men would <i>hokkawar</i>
with mules and asses, and the women told <i>baji</i>, <a
name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a> and after many days we came before a
large town, and the black man said, &lsquo;Go in there, little
sister, and there you will find your <i>ro</i>;&rsquo; and I went
to the gate, and an armed <i>Corahan&oacute;</i> stood within the
gate, and I looked in his face, and lo! it was my <i>ro</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a strange town it was that I found myself in,
full of people who had once been <i>Candor&eacute;</i> but had
renegaded and become <i>Corahai</i>!&nbsp; There were
<i>Ses&eacute;</i> and <i>Lalor&eacute;</i>, and men of other
nations, <a name="page1_119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>and amongst them were some of the <i>Errate</i> from my
own country; all were now soldiers of the <i>Crallis</i> of the
<i>Corahai</i>, and followed him to his wars; and in that town I
remained with my <i>ro</i> a long time, occasionally going out
with him to the wars, and I often asked him about the black men
who had brought me thither, and he told me that he had had
dealings with them, and that he believed them to be of the
<i>Errate</i>.&nbsp; Well, brother, to be short, my <i>ro</i> was
killed in the wars, before a town to which the king of the
<i>Corahai</i> laid siege, and I became a <i>piul&iacute;</i>,
and I returned to the village of the renegades, as it was called,
and supported myself as well as I could; and one day, as I was
sitting weeping, the black man, whom I had never seen since the
day he brought me to my <i>ro</i>, again stood before me, and he
said, &lsquo;Come with me, little sister, come with me, the
<i>ro</i> is at hand,&rsquo; and I went with him, and beyond the
gate in the desert was the same party of black men and women
which I had seen before.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is my
<i>ro</i>?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here he is, little
sister,&rsquo; said the black man, &lsquo;here he is; from this
day I am the <i>ro</i> and you the <i>romi</i>.&nbsp; Come, let
us go, for there is business to be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I went with him, and he was my <i>ro</i>, and we
lived amongst the deserts, and <i>hokkawar&rsquo;d</i> and
<i>choried</i> and told <i>baji</i>; and I said to myself,
&lsquo;This is good; sure I am amongst the <i>Errate</i> in a
better <i>chim</i> than my own.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I often said
that they were of the <i>Errate</i>, and then they would laugh
and say that it might be so, and that they were not
<i>Corahai</i>, but they could give no account of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things went on in this way for years, and I had
three <i>chai</i> by the black man; two of them <a
name="page1_120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>died, but
the youngest, who is the <i>Call&iacute;</i> who sits by the
<i>brasero</i>, was spared.&nbsp; So we roamed about and
<i>choried</i> and told <i>baji</i>; and it came to pass that
once in the winter time our company attempted to pass a wide and
deep river, of which there are many in the <i>Chim del
Corahai</i>, and the boat overset with the rapidity of the
current, and all our people were drowned, all but myself and my
<i>chab&iacute;</i>, whom I bore in my bosom.&nbsp; I had now no
friends amongst the <i>Corahai</i>, and I wandered about the
<i>despoblados</i> howling and lamenting till I became half
<i>lil&iacute;</i>, and in this manner I found my way to the
coast, where I made friends with the captain of a ship, and
returned to this land of Spain.&nbsp; And now I am here, I often
wish myself back again amongst the <i>Corahai</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she commenced laughing loud and long, and when she had
ceased, her daughter and grandchild took up the laugh, which they
continued so long that I concluded they were all lunatics.</p>
<p>Hour succeeded hour, and still we sat crouching over the
<i>brasero</i>, from which, by this time, all warmth had
departed; the glow had long since disappeared, and only a few
dying sparks were to be distinguished.&nbsp; The room or hall was
now involved in utter darkness; the women were motionless and
still; I shivered and began to feel uneasy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
Antonio be here to-night?&rdquo; at length I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No tenga usted cuidao</i>, <a
name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a> my London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>,&rdquo;
said the gypsy mother, in an unearthly tone;
&ldquo;<i>Pepindorio</i> has been here some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to rise from my seat and attempt to escape from
the house, when I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder, and in a
moment I heard the voice of Antonio.</p>
<p><a name="page1_121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Be not afraid; &rsquo;tis I, brother.&nbsp; We
will have a light anon, and then supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The supper was rude enough, consisting of bread, cheese, and
olives; Antonio, however, produced a leathern bottle of excellent
wine.&nbsp; We despatched these viands by the light of an earthen
lamp, which was placed upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Antonio to the youngest female,
&ldquo;bring me the <i>pajand&iacute;</i>, and I will sing a
<i>gachapla</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl brought the guitar, which, with some difficulty, the
gypsy tuned, and then, strumming it vigorously, he
sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I stole a plump and bonny fowl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ere I well had din&rsquo;d,<br />
The master came with scowl and growl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And me would captive bind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hat and mantle off I threw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scour&rsquo;d across the lea;<br />
Then cried the <i>beng</i> with loud halloo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does the gypsy flee?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued playing and singing for a considerable time, the
two younger females dancing in the meanwhile with unwearied
diligence, whilst the aged mother occasionally snapped her
fingers or beat time on the ground with her stick.&nbsp; At last
Antonio suddenly laid down the instrument, exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the London <i>Calor&oacute;</i> is weary; enough,
enough, to-morrow more thereof.&nbsp; We will now to the
<i>charip&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where are we
to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the stable,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the manger;
however cold the stable may be, we shall be warm enough in the
<i>bufa</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Discourse&mdash;What is Truth?&mdash;Unexpected Intelligence.</p>
<p>We remained three days at the gypsies&rsquo; house, Antonio
departing early every morning, on his mule, and returning late at
night.&nbsp; The house was large and ruinous, the only habitable
part of it, with the exception of the stable, being the hall,
where we had supped, and there the gypsy females slept at night,
on some mats and mattresses in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange house is this,&rdquo; said I to Antonio, one
morning as he was on the point of saddling his mule and
departing, as I supposed, on the affairs of Egypt; &ldquo;a
strange house and strange people.&nbsp; That gypsy grandmother
has all the appearance of a <i>sowanee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the appearance of one!&rdquo; said Antonio;
&ldquo;and is she not really one?&nbsp; She knows more crabbed
things and crabbed words than all the <i>Errate</i> betwixt here
and Catalonia.&nbsp; She has been amongst the wild Moors, and can
make more <i>draos</i>, <a name="citation122"></a><a
href="#footnote122" class="citation">[122]</a> poisons, and <a
name="page1_123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>philtres
than any one alive.&nbsp; She once made a kind of paste, and
persuaded me to taste, and shortly after I had done so my soul
departed from my body, and wandered through horrid forests and
mountains, amidst monsters and <i>duendes</i>, during one entire
night.&nbsp; She learned many things amidst the <i>Corahai</i>
which I should be glad to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been long acquainted with her?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You appear to be quite at home in this
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acquainted with her!&rdquo; said Antonio.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did not my own brother marry the black
<i>Call&iacute;</i>, her daughter, who bore him the
<i>chab&iacute;</i>, sixteen years ago, just before he was hanged
by the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon I was seated with the gypsy mother in the
hall, the two <i>Callees</i> were absent telling fortunes about
the town and neighbourhood, which was their principal
occupation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you married, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>?&rdquo; said the old woman to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you a <i>ro</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Wherefore do you ask, <i>O Dai de los
Cal&eacute;s</i>? <a name="citation123a"></a><a
href="#footnote123a" class="citation">[123a]</a></p>
<p><i>Gypsy Mother</i>.&mdash;It is high time that the
<i>lacha</i> <a name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> of the <i>chabi</i> were taken from
her, and that she had a <i>ro</i>.&nbsp; You can do no better
than take her for <i>rom&iacute;</i>, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I am a stranger in this land, O mother of
the gypsies, and scarcely know how to provide for myself, much
less for a <i>rom&iacute;</i>.</p>
<p><i>Gypsy Mother</i>.&mdash;She wants no one to provide for
her, my London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>; she can at any time provide
for herself and her <i>ro</i>.&nbsp; She can <i>hokkawar</i>,
tell <i>baji</i>, <a name="page1_124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and there are few to equal her at
stealing <i>&aacute; pastesas</i>. <a name="citation124"></a><a
href="#footnote124" class="citation">[124]</a>&nbsp; Were she
once at <i>Madrilati</i>, where they tell me you are going, she
would make much treasure; therefore take her thither, for in this
<i>foros</i> she is <i>nahi</i>, as it were, for there is nothing
to be gained; but in the <i>foros baro</i> it would be another
matter; she would go dressed in <i>lachip&eacute;</i> and
<i>sonacai</i>, whilst you would ride about on your black-tailed
<i>gra</i>; and when you had got much treasure, you might return
hither and live like a <i>Crallis</i>, and all the <i>Errate</i>
of the <i>Chim del Manr&oacute;</i> should bow down their heads
to you.&nbsp; What say you, my London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>, what
say you to my plan?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Your plan is a plausible one, mother, or
at least some people would think so; but I am, as you are aware,
of another <i>chim</i>, and have no inclination to pass my life
in this country.</p>
<p><i>Gypsy Mother</i>.&mdash;Then return to your own country, my
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>, the <i>chab&iacute;</i> can cross the
<i>pa&ntilde;&iacute;</i>.&nbsp; Would she not do business in
London with the rest of the <i>Calor&eacute;</i>?&nbsp; Or why
not go to the land of the <i>Corahai</i>?&nbsp; In which case I
would accompany you; I and my daughter, the mother of the
<i>chab&iacute;</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what should we do in the land of the
<i>Corahai</i>?&nbsp; It is a poor and wild country, I
believe.</p>
<p><i>Gypsy Mother</i>.&mdash;The London <i>Calor&oacute;</i>
asks me what we could do in the land of the <i>Corahai</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Aromali</i>! I almost think that I am speaking to a
<i>lilipendi</i>.&nbsp; Are there not horses to
<i>chore</i>?&nbsp; Yes, I trow there are, and better ones than
in this land, and asses and mules.&nbsp; In the land of the
<i>Corahai</i> you must <i>hokkawar</i> and <i>chore</i> even as
you must here, or in your own <a name="page1_125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>country, or else you are no
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>.&nbsp; Can you not join yourselves with the
black people who live in the <i>despoblados</i>?&nbsp; Yes,
surely; and glad they would be to have among them the
<i>Errate</i> from Spain and London.&nbsp; I am seventy years of
age, but I wish not to die in this <i>chim</i>, but yonder, far
away, where both my <i>roms</i> are sleeping.&nbsp; Take the
<i>chab&iacute;</i>, therefore, and go to <i>Madrilati</i> to win
the <i>parn&eacute;</i>, and when you have got it, return, and we
will give a banquet to all the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> in Merida, and
in their food I will mix <i>drao</i>, and they shall eat and
burst like poisoned sheep. . . .&nbsp; And when they have eaten
we will leave them, and away to the land of the Moor, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>.</p>
<p>During the whole time that I remained at Merida I stirred not
once from the house; following the advice of Antonio, who
informed me that it would not be convenient.&nbsp; My time lay
rather heavily on my hands, my only source of amusement
consisting in the conversation of the women, and in that of
Antonio when he made his appearance at night.&nbsp; In these
<i>tertulias</i> the grandmother was the principal spokeswoman,
and astonished my ears with wonderful tales of the land of the
Moors, prison escapes, thievish feats, and one or two poisoning
adventures, in which she had been engaged, as she informed me, in
her early youth.</p>
<p>There was occasionally something very wild in her gestures and
demeanour; more than once I observed her, in the midst of much
declamation, to stop short, stare in vacancy, and thrust out her
palms as if endeavouring to push away some invisible substance;
she goggled frightfully with her eyes, and once sank back in
convulsions, of which her children took no <a
name="page1_126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>farther
notice than observing that she was only <i>lil&iacute;</i>, and
would soon come to herself.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of the third day, as the three women and
myself sat conversing as usual over the <i>brasero</i>, a
shabby-looking fellow in an old rusty cloak walked into the
room.&nbsp; He came straight up to the place where we were
sitting, produced a paper cigar, which he lighted at a coal, and
taking a whiff or two, looked at me:
&ldquo;<i>Carracho</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who is this
companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw at once that the fellow was no gypsy: the women said
nothing, but I could hear the grandmother growling to herself,
something after the manner of an old grimalkin when
disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carracho</i>,&rdquo; reiterated the fellow,
&ldquo;how came this companion here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No le penela chi</i>, <i>min
chabor&oacute;</i>,&rdquo; said the black <i>Callee</i> to me, in
an undertone; &ldquo;<i>sin un balich&oacute; de los
chineles</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a> then looking up to
the interrogator, she said aloud, &ldquo;He is one of our people
from Portugal, come on the smuggling lay, and to see his poor
sisters here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let him give me some tobacco,&rdquo; said the
fellow; &ldquo;I suppose he has brought some with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no tobacco,&rdquo; said the black <i>Callee</i>;
&ldquo;he has nothing but old iron.&nbsp; This cigar is the only
tobacco there is in the house; take it, smoke it, and go
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon she produced a cigar from out her shoe, which she
presented to the <i>alguazil</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; said the fellow, taking the
cigar; &ldquo;I must have something better.&nbsp; It is now three
months since I received anything from you.&nbsp; The last <a
name="page1_127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>present
was a handkerchief, which was good for nothing; therefore hand me
over something worth taking, or I will carry you all to the
<i>Carcel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Busn&oacute;</i> will take us to prison,&rdquo;
said the black <i>Callee</i>; &ldquo;ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Chinel</i> will take us to prison,&rdquo;
giggled the young girl; &ldquo;he! he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Bengui</i> will carry us all to the
<i>estaripel</i>,&rdquo; grunted the gypsy grandmother;
&ldquo;ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three females arose and walked slowly round the fellow,
fixing their eyes steadfastly on his face; he appeared
frightened, and evidently wished to get away.&nbsp; Suddenly the
two youngest seized his hands, and whilst he struggled to release
himself, the old woman exclaimed, &ldquo;You want tobacco,
<i>hijo</i>&mdash;you come to the gypsy house to frighten the
<i>Callees</i> and the strange <i>Calor&oacute;</i> out of their
<i>plako</i>&mdash;truly, <i>hijo</i>, we have none for you, and
right sorry I am; we have, however, plenty of the dust
<i>&aacute; su servicio</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation127"></a><a
href="#footnote127" class="citation">[127]</a></p>
<p>Here, thrusting her hand into her pocket, she discharged a
handful of some kind of dust or snuff into the fellow&rsquo;s
eyes; he stamped and roared, but was for some time held fast by
the two <i>Callees</i>.&nbsp; He extricated himself, however, and
attempted to unsheath a knife which he bore at his girdle; but
the two younger females flung themselves upon him like furies,
while the old woman increased his disorder by thrusting her stick
into his face; he was soon glad to give up the contest, and
retreated, leaving behind him his hat and cloak, which the
<i>chab&iacute;</i> gathered up and flung after him into the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a bad business,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the
fellow will <a name="page1_128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>of course bring the rest of the <i>justicia</i> upon
us, and we shall all be cast into the
<i>estaripel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca</i>!&rdquo; said the black <i>Callee</i>, biting
her thumb-nail, &ldquo;he has more reason to fear us than we
him.&nbsp; We could bring him to the <i>filimicha</i>; we have,
moreover, friends in this town&mdash;plenty, plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; mumbled the grandmother, &ldquo;the
daughters of the <i>baji</i> have friends, my London
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>, friends among the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>,
<i>baributre</i>, <i>barib&uacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing farther of any account occurred in the gypsy
house.&nbsp; The next day, Antonio and myself were again in the
saddle; we travelled at least thirteen leagues before we reached
the <i>venta</i>, where we passed the night.&nbsp; We rose early
in the morning, my guide informing me that we had a long
day&rsquo;s journey to make.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are we bound
to?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Trujillo,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>When the sun arose, which it did gloomily, and amidst
threatening rain-clouds, we found ourselves in the neighbourhood
of a range of mountains which lay on our left, and which, Antonio
informed me, were called the Sierra of San Selvan.&nbsp; Our
route, however, lay over wide plains, scantily clothed with
brushwood, with here and there a melancholy village, with its old
and dilapidated church.&nbsp; Throughout the greater part of the
day, a drizzling rain was falling, which turned the dust of the
roads into mud and mire, considerably impeding our
progress.&nbsp; Towards evening we reached a moor, a wild place
enough, strewn with enormous stones and rocks.&nbsp; Before us,
at some distance, rose a strange conical hill, rough and shaggy,
which appeared to be neither more nor less than an immense
assemblage of the same kind of rocks which lay upon the
moor.&nbsp; The rain had now ceased, <a
name="page1_129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>but a
strong wind rose and howled at our backs.&nbsp; Throughout the
journey, I had experienced considerable difficulty in keeping up
with the mule of Antonio; the walk of the horse was slow, and I
could discover no vestige of the spirit which the gypsy had
assured me lurked within him.&nbsp; We were now upon a tolerably
clear spot of the moor: &ldquo;I am about to see,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;whether this horse has any of the quality which you have
described.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said Antonio, and
spurred his beast onward, speedily leaving me far behind.&nbsp; I
jerked the horse with the bit, endeavouring to arouse his dormant
spirit, whereupon he stopped, reared, and refused to
proceed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold the bridle loose, and touch him with
your whip,&rdquo; shouted Antonio from before.&nbsp; I obeyed,
and forthwith the animal set off at a trot, which gradually
increased in swiftness till it became a downright furious speedy
trot; his limbs were now thoroughly lithy, and he brandished his
fore-legs in a manner perfectly wondrous.&nbsp; The mule of
Antonio, which was a spirited animal of excellent paces, would
fain have competed with him, but was passed in a twinkling.&nbsp;
This tremendous trot endured for about a mile, when the animal,
becoming yet more heated, broke suddenly into a gallop.&nbsp;
Hurrah! no hare ever ran so wildly or blindly; it was, literally,
<i>ventre &agrave; terre</i>; and I had considerable difficulty
in keeping him clear of rocks, against which he would have rushed
in his savage fury, and dashed himself and rider to atoms.</p>
<p>This race brought me to the foot of the hill, where I waited
till the gypsy rejoined me.&nbsp; We left the hill, which seemed
quite inaccessible, on our right, passing through a small and
wretched village.&nbsp; The sun went down, and dark night
presently came upon us; we <a name="page1_130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>proceeded on, however, for nearly
three hours, until we heard the barking of dogs, and perceived a
light or two in the distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is
Trujillo,&rdquo; said Antonio, who had not spoken for a long
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I am
thoroughly tired; I shall sleep soundly in Trujillo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is as it may be,&rdquo; said the gypsy, and spurred
his mule to a brisker pace.&nbsp; We soon entered the town, which
appeared dark and gloomy enough; I followed close behind the
gypsy, who led the way I knew not whither, through dismal streets
and dark places, where cats were squalling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
the house,&rdquo; said he at last, dismounting before a low mean
hut.&nbsp; He knocked&mdash;no answer was returned; he knocked
again, but still there was no reply; he shook the door and
essayed to open it, but it appeared firmly locked and
bolted.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they
are out&mdash;I feared it might be so.&nbsp; Now, what are we to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no difficulty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with
respect to what we have to do; if your friends are gone out, it
is easy enough to go to a <i>posada</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know not what you say,&rdquo; replied the
gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare not go to the <i>mesuna</i>, nor enter
any house in Trujillo save this, and this is shut.&nbsp; Well,
there is no remedy; we must move on, and, between ourselves, the
sooner we leave this place the better; my own
<i>planor&oacute;</i> was garroted at Trujillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted a cigar, by means of a steel and <i>yesca</i>,
sprang on his mule, and proceeded through streets and lanes
equally dismal as those which we had already traversed, till we
again found ourselves out of the town.</p>
<p>I confess I did not much like this decision of the gypsy; I
felt very slight inclination to leave the town <a
name="page1_131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>behind,
and to venture into unknown places in the dark night, amidst rain
and mist, for the wind had now dropped, and the rain began again
to fall briskly.&nbsp; I was, moreover, much fatigued, and wished
for nothing better than to deposit myself in some comfortable
manger, where I might sink to sleep, lulled by the pleasant sound
of horses and mules despatching their provender.&nbsp; I had,
however, put myself under the direction of the gypsy, and I was
too old a traveller to quarrel with my guide under the present
circumstances.&nbsp; I therefore followed close at his crupper,
our only light being the glow emitted from the gypsy&rsquo;s
cigar; at last he flung it from his mouth into a puddle, and we
were then in darkness.</p>
<p>We proceeded in this manner for a long time.&nbsp; The gypsy
was silent; I myself was equally so; the rain descended more and
more.&nbsp; I sometimes thought I heard doleful noises, something
like the hooting of owls.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a strange night to
be wandering abroad in,&rdquo; I at length said to Antonio.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is, brother,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I would sooner
be abroad in such a night, and in such places, than in the
<i>estaripel</i> of Trujillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We wandered at least a league farther, and appeared now to be
near a wood, for I could occasionally distinguish the trunks of
immense trees.&nbsp; Suddenly Antonio stopped his mule.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look, brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the left, and
tell me if you do not see a light; your eyes are sharper than
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did as he commanded me.&nbsp; At first I
could see nothing, but, moving a little farther on, I plainly saw
a large light at some distance, seemingly amongst the
trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yonder cannot be a lamp or candle,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it is more like the blaze of a fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said <a name="page1_132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no
<i>queres</i> in this place; it is doubtless a fire made by
<i>durotunes</i>.&nbsp; Let us go and join them, for, as you say,
it is doleful work wandering about at night amidst rain and
mire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We dismounted and entered what I now saw was a forest, leading
the animals cautiously amongst the trees and brushwood.&nbsp; In
about five minutes we reached a small open space, at the farther
side of which, at the foot of a large cork-tree, a fire was
burning, and by it stood or sat two or three figures; they had
heard our approach, and one of them now exclaimed,
&ldquo;<i>Quien vive</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation132"></a><a
href="#footnote132" class="citation">[132]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know that voice,&rdquo; said Antonio; and, leaving the horse with
me, rapidly advanced towards the fire.&nbsp; Presently I heard an
<i>Ola</i>! and a laugh, and soon the voice of Antonio summoned
me to advance.&nbsp; On reaching the fire I found two dark lads,
and a still darker woman of about forty; the latter seated on
what appeared to be horse or mule furniture.&nbsp; I likewise saw
a horse and two donkeys tethered to the neighbouring trees.&nbsp;
It was, in fact, a gypsy bivouac. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
forward, brother, and show yourself,&rdquo; said Antonio to me;
&ldquo;you are amongst friends.&nbsp; These are of the
<i>Errate</i>, the very people whom I expected to find at
Trujillo, and in whose house we should have slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;could have induced them
to leave their house in Trujillo and come into this dark forest,
in the midst of wind and rain, to pass the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come on business of Egypt, brother,
doubtless,&rdquo; replied Antonio; &ldquo;and that business is
none of <a name="page1_133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>ours.&nbsp; <i>Calla boca</i>! <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a>&nbsp; It is lucky we have found them
here, else we should have had no supper, and our horses no
corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>ro</i> is prisoner at the village yonder,&rdquo;
said the woman, pointing with her hand in a particular direction;
&ldquo;he is prisoner yonder for <i>choring a mailla</i>. <a
name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a>&nbsp; We are come to see what we can
do in his behalf; and where can we lodge better than in this
forest, where there is nothing to pay?&nbsp; It is not the first
time, I trow, that <i>Calor&eacute;</i> have slept at the root of
a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the striplings now gave us barley for our animals in a
large bag, into which we successively introduced their heads,
allowing the famished creatures to regale themselves till we
conceived that they had satisfied their hunger.&nbsp; There was a
<i>puchero</i> simmering at the fire, half full of bacon,
<i>garbanzos</i>, and other provisions; this was emptied into a
large wooden platter, and out of this Antonio and myself
supped.&nbsp; The other gypsies refused to join us, giving us to
understand that they had eaten before our arrival; they all,
however, did justice to the leathern bottle of Antonio, which,
before his departure from Merida, he had the precaution to
fill.</p>
<p>I was by this time completely overcome with fatigue and
sleep.&nbsp; Antonio flung me an immense horse-cloth, of which he
bore more than one beneath the huge cushion on which he rode; in
this I wrapped myself, and placing my head upon a bundle, and my
feet as near as possible to the fire, I lay down.</p>
<p>Antonio and the other gypsies remained seated by the fire
conversing.&nbsp; I listened for a moment to what they said, but
I did not perfectly understand it, and what I did understand by
no means interested me.&nbsp; <a name="page1_134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>The rain still drizzled, but I
heeded it not, and was soon asleep.</p>
<p>The sun was just appearing as I awoke.&nbsp; I made several
efforts before I could rise from the ground; my limbs were quite
stiff, and my hair was covered with rime, for the rain had ceased
and a rather severe frost set in.&nbsp; I looked around me, but
could see neither Antonio nor the gypsies.&nbsp; The animals of
the latter had likewise disappeared, so had the horse which I had
hitherto rode; the mule, however, of Antonio still remained
fastened to the tree.&nbsp; This latter circumstance quieted some
apprehensions which were beginning to arise in my mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are gone on some business of Egypt,&rdquo; I said to
myself, &ldquo;and will return anon.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gathered
together the embers of the fire, and heaping upon them sticks and
branches, soon succeeded in calling forth a blaze, beside which I
again placed the <i>puchero</i>, with what remained of the
provision of last night.&nbsp; I waited for a considerable time
in expectation of the return of my companions, but as they did
not appear, I sat down and breakfasted.&nbsp; Before I had well
finished I heard the noise of a horse approaching rapidly, and
presently Antonio made his appearance amongst the trees, with
some agitation in his countenance.&nbsp; He sprang from the
horse, and instantly proceeded to untie the mule.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mount, brother, mount!&rdquo; said he, pointing to the
horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went with the <i>Callee</i> and her
<i>chab&eacute;s</i> to the village where the <i>ro</i> is in
trouble; the <i>chinobar&oacute;</i>, however, seized them at
once with their cattle, and would have laid hands also on me, but
I set spurs to the <i>grasti</i>, gave him the bridle, and was
soon far away.&nbsp; Mount, brother, mount, or we shall have the
whole rustic <i>canaille</i> upon us in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I
did as he commanded: we were presently in the road which we had
left the night before.&nbsp; Along this we hurried at a great
rate, the horse displaying his best speedy trot; whilst the mule,
with its ears pricked up, galloped gallantly at his side.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What place is that on the hill yonder?&rdquo; said I to
Antonio, at the expiration of an hour, as we prepared to descend
a deep valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Jaraicejo,&rdquo; said Antonio; &ldquo;a bad
place it is, and a bad place it has ever been for the
<i>Cal&oacute;</i> people.&rdquo; <a name="citation135"></a><a
href="#footnote135" class="citation">[135]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is such a bad place,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I hope
we shall not have to pass through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must pass through it,&rdquo; said Antonio,
&ldquo;for more reasons than one: first, forasmuch as the road
lies through Jaraicejo; and, second, forasmuch as it will be
necessary to purchase provisions there, both for ourselves and
horses.&nbsp; On the other side of Jaraicejo there is a wild
desert, a <i>despoblado</i>, where we shall find
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We crossed the valley, and ascended the hill, and as we drew
near to the town, the gypsy said, &ldquo;Brother, we had best
pass through that town singly.&nbsp; I will go in advance; follow
slowly, and when there purchase bread and barley; you have
nothing to fear.&nbsp; I will await you on the
<i>despoblado</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for my answer he hastened forward, and was
speedily out of sight.</p>
<p>I followed slowly behind, and entered the gate of the town, an
old dilapidated place, consisting of little more than one
street.&nbsp; Along this street I was advancing, when a man with
a dirty foraging cap on his head, and holding a gun in his hand,
came running <a name="page1_136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>up to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said he, in
rather rough accents; &ldquo;from whence do you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Badajoz and Trujillo,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;why
do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of the national guard,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;and am placed here to inspect strangers.&nbsp; I am told
that a gypsy fellow just now rode through the town; it is well
for him that I had stepped into my house.&nbsp; Do you come in
his company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look a person,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;likely to
keep company with gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national measured me from top to toe, and then looked me
full in the face with an expression which seemed to say,
&ldquo;likely enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, my appearance was by
no means calculated to prepossess people in my favour.&nbsp; Upon
my head I wore an old Andalusian hat, which, from its condition,
appeared to have been trodden underfoot; a rusty cloak, which had
perhaps served half a dozen generations, enwrapped my body.&nbsp;
My nether garments were by no means of the finest description,
and, as far as could be seen, were covered with mud, with which
my face was likewise plentifully bespattered, and upon my chin
was a beard of a week&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a passport?&rdquo; at length demanded the
national.</p>
<p>I remembered having read that the best way to win a
Spaniard&rsquo;s heart is to treat him with ceremonious
civility.&nbsp; I therefore dismounted, and taking off my hat,
made a low bow to the constitutional soldier, saying,
&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or nacional</i>, you must know that I am an
English gentleman, travelling in this country for my
pleasure.&nbsp; I bear a passport, which, on inspecting, you will
find to be perfectly regular; it was given me by <a
name="page1_137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>the great
Lord Palmerston, minister of England, whom you of course have
heard of here; at the bottom you will see his own
handwriting.&nbsp; Look at it and rejoice; perhaps you will never
have another opportunity.&nbsp; As I put unbounded confidence in
the honour of every gentleman, I leave the passport in your hands
whilst I repair to the <i>posada</i> to refresh myself.&nbsp;
When you have inspected it, you will perhaps oblige me so far as
to bring it to me.&nbsp; Cavalier, I kiss your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then made him another low bow, which he returned with one
still lower, and leaving him now staring at the passport and now
looking at myself, I went into a posada, to which I was directed
by a beggar whom I met.</p>
<p>I fed the horse, and procured some bread and barley, as the
gypsy had directed me; I likewise purchased three fine partridges
of a fowler, who was drinking wine in the <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; He
was satisfied with the price I gave him, and offered to treat me
with a <i>copita</i>, to which I made no objection.&nbsp; As we
sat discoursing at the table, the national entered with the
passport in his hand, and sat down by us.</p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;<i>Caballero</i>!&nbsp; I return you
your passport; it is quite in form.&nbsp; I rejoice much to have
made your acquaintance; I have no doubt that you can give me some
information respecting the present war.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I shall be very happy to afford so polite
and honourable a gentleman any information in my power.</p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;What is England doing?&nbsp; Is she
about to afford any assistance to this country?&nbsp; If she
pleased she could put down the war in three months.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Be under no apprehension, <i>Se&ntilde;or
nacional</i>; the war will be put down, don&rsquo;t doubt.&nbsp;
You have <a name="page1_138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>heard of the English legion, <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a> which my Lord Palmerston has sent
over?&nbsp; Leave the matter in their hands, and you will soon
see the result.</p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;It appears to me that this
<i>Caballero</i> Balmerson must be a very honest man.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;There can be no doubt of it.</p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;I have heard that he is a great
general.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;There can be no doubt of it.&nbsp; In
some things neither Napoleon nor the Sawyer <a
name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a> would stand a chance with him for a
moment.&nbsp; <i>Es mucho hombre</i>. <a
name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a></p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;I am glad to hear it.&nbsp; Does he
intend to head the legion himself?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I believe not; but he has sent over, to
head the fighting men, a friend of his, who is thought to be
nearly as much versed in military matters as himself.</p>
<p><i>National</i>.&mdash;I am rejoiced to hear it.&nbsp; I see
that the war will soon be over.&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>, I thank
you for your politeness, and for the information which you have
afforded me.&nbsp; I hope you will have a pleasant journey.&nbsp;
I confess that I am surprised to see a gentleman of your country
travelling alone, and in this manner, through such regions as
these.&nbsp; The roads are at present very bad; there have of
late been many accidents, and more than two deaths in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The <i>despoblado</i> out yonder has a
particularly evil name; be on your guard, <i>Caballero</i>.&nbsp;
I am sorry that gypsy was permitted to pass; should you meet him
and not like his looks, shoot him at once, stab him, or ride him
down.&nbsp; He is a well-known thief, <i>contrabandista</i>, and
murderer, and has committed more assassinations than he has
fingers on his hands.&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>, if you <a
name="page1_139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>please,
we will allow you a guard to the other side of the pass.&nbsp;
You do not wish it?&nbsp; Then, farewell.&nbsp; Stay, before I go
I should wish to see once more the signature of the
<i>Caballero</i> Balmerson.</p>
<p>I showed him the signature, which he looked upon with profound
reverence, uncovering his head for a moment.&nbsp; We then
embraced and parted.</p>
<p>I mounted the horse and rode from the town, at first
proceeding very slowly.&nbsp; I had no sooner, however, reached
the moor, than I put the animal to his speedy trot, and proceeded
at a tremendous rate for some time, expecting every moment to
overtake the gypsy.&nbsp; I, however, saw nothing of him, nor did
I meet with a single human being.&nbsp; The road along which I
sped was narrow and sandy, winding amidst thickets of broom and
brushwood, with which the <i>despoblado</i> was overgrown, and
which in some places were as high as a man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
Across the moor, in the direction in which I was proceeding, rose
a lofty eminence, naked and bare.&nbsp; The moor extended for at
least three leagues; I had nearly crossed it, and reached the
foot of the ascent.&nbsp; I was becoming very uneasy, conceiving
that I might have passed the gypsy amongst the thickets, when I
suddenly heard his well-known <i>Ola</i>! and his black savage
head and staring eyes suddenly appeared from amidst a clump of
broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tarried long, brother,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I almost thought you had played me false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bade me dismount, and then proceeded to lead the horse
behind the thicket, where I found the mule picqueted to the
ground.&nbsp; I gave him the barley and provisions, and then
proceeded to relate to him my adventure with the national.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would I had him here,&rdquo; said the gypsy, on <a
name="page1_140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>hearing
the epithets which the former had lavished upon
him&mdash;&ldquo;I would I had him here, then should my
<i>chul&iacute;</i> and his <i>carlo</i> become better
acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing here yourself,&rdquo; I
demanded, &ldquo;in this wild place, amidst these
thickets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am expecting a messenger down yon pass,&rdquo; said
the gypsy; &ldquo;and till that messenger arrive I can neither go
forward nor return.&nbsp; It is on business of Egypt, brother,
that I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he invariably used this last expression when he wished to
evade my inquiries, I held my peace, and said no more.&nbsp; The
animals were fed, and we proceeded to make a frugal repast on
bread and wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not cook the game which I brought?&rdquo; I
demanded; &ldquo;in this place there is plenty of materials for a
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke might discover us, brother,&rdquo; said
Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am desirous of lying <i>escondido</i> in
this place until the arrival of the messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now considerably past noon.&nbsp; The gypsy lay behind
the thicket, raising himself up occasionally and looking
anxiously towards the hill which lay over against us; at last,
with an exclamation of disappointment and impatience, he flung
himself on the ground, where he lay a considerable time,
apparently ruminating; at last he lifted up his head and looked
me in the face.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Brother, I cannot imagine what business
brought you to this country.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Perhaps the same which brings you to this
moor&mdash;business of Egypt.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Not so, brother; you speak the language
of Egypt, it is true, but your ways and words are neither those
of the <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> nor of the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page1_141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Did you not hear me speak in the
<i>foros</i> about God and <i>Tebleque</i>?&nbsp; It was to
declare His glory to the <i>Cal&eacute;s</i> and Gentiles that I
came to the land of Spain.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;And who sent you on this errand?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You would scarcely understand me were I
to inform you.&nbsp; Know, however, that there are many in
foreign lands who lament the darkness which envelops Spain, and
the scenes of cruelty, robbery, and murder which deform it.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Are they <i>Calor&eacute;</i> or
<i>Busn&eacute;</i>?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What matters it?&nbsp; Both
<i>Calor&eacute;</i> and <i>Busn&eacute;</i> are sons of the same
God.</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;You lie, brother; they are not of one
father nor of one <i>Errate</i>.&nbsp; You speak of robbery,
cruelty, and murder.&nbsp; There are too many
<i>Busn&eacute;</i>, brother; if there were no
<i>Busn&eacute;</i> there would be neither robbery nor
murder.&nbsp; The <i>Calor&eacute;</i> neither rob nor murder
each other, the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> do; nor are they cruel to
their animals, their law forbids them.&nbsp; When I was a child I
was beating a <i>burra</i>, but my father stopped my hand, and
chided me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurt not the animal,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;for within it is the soul of your own sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And do you believe in this wild doctrine,
O Antonio?</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i>.&mdash;Sometimes I do, sometimes I do
not.&nbsp; There are some who believe in nothing; not even that
they live!&nbsp; Long since, I knew an old
<i>Calor&oacute;</i>&mdash;he was old, very old, upwards of a
hundred years&mdash;and I once heard him say, that all we thought
we saw was a lie; that there was no world, no men nor women, no
horses nor mules, no olive-trees.&nbsp; But whither are we
straying?&nbsp; I asked what induced you to come to this
country&mdash;you tell me, the glory of God and <a
name="page1_142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span><i>Tebleque</i>.&nbsp; <i>Disparate</i>! tell that to
the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; You have good reasons for coming,
no doubt, else you would not be here.&nbsp; Some say you are a
spy of the <i>London&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps you are; I care
not.&nbsp; Rise, brother, and tell me whether any one is coming
down the pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a distant object,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;like a
speck on the side of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy started up, and we both fixed our eyes on the
object: the distance was so great that it was at first with
difficulty that we could distinguish whether it moved or
not.&nbsp; A quarter of an hour, however, dispelled all doubts,
for within this time it had nearly reached the bottom of the
hill, and we could descry a figure seated on an animal of some
kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a woman,&rdquo; said I, at length, &ldquo;mounted
on a grey donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is my messenger,&rdquo; said Antonio,
&ldquo;for it can be no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman and the donkey were now upon the plain, and for some
time were concealed from us by the copse and brushwood which
intervened.&nbsp; They were not long, however, in making their
appearance at the distance of about a hundred yards.&nbsp; The
donkey was a beautiful creature of a silver grey, and came
frisking along, swinging her tail, and moving her feet so quick
that they scarcely seemed to touch the ground.&nbsp; The animal
no sooner perceived us than she stopped short, turned round, and
attempted to escape by the way she had come; her rider, however,
detained her, whereupon the donkey kicked violently, and would
probably have flung the former, had she not sprung nimbly to the
ground.&nbsp; The form of the woman was entirely concealed by the
large wrapping man&rsquo;s cloak which she <a
name="page1_143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>wore.&nbsp; I ran to assist her, when she turned her
face full upon me, and I instantly recognized the sharp, clever
features of Antonia, whom I had seen at Badajoz, the daughter of
my guide.&nbsp; She said nothing to me, but advancing to her
father, addressed something to him in a low voice, which I did
not hear.&nbsp; He started back, and vociferated
&ldquo;All!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she in a louder
tone, probably repeating the words which I had not caught before,
&ldquo;All are captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy remained for some time like one astounded, and,
unwilling to listen to their discourse, which I imagined might
relate to business of Egypt, I walked away amidst the
thickets.&nbsp; I was absent for some time, but could
occasionally hear passionate expressions and oaths.&nbsp; In
about half an hour I returned; they had left the road, but I
found them behind the broom clump, where the animals stood.&nbsp;
Both were seated on the ground.&nbsp; The features of the gypsy
were peculiarly dark and grim; he held his unsheathed knife in
his hand, which he would occasionally plunge into the earth,
exclaiming, &ldquo;All!&nbsp; All!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I can go no
farther with you; the business which carried me to
<i>Castumba</i> is settled.&nbsp; You must now travel by yourself
and trust to your <i>baji</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust in <i>Undevel</i>,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;who
wrote my fortune long ago.&nbsp; But how am I to journey?&nbsp; I
have no horse, for you doubtless want your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gypsy appeared to reflect.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want the horse,
it is true, brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and likewise the
<i>macho</i>; but you shall not go <i>en pindr&eacute;</i>; <a
name="citation143"></a><a href="#footnote143"
class="citation">[143]</a> you shall purchase the <i>burra</i> of
Antonia, which I presented her when I sent her upon this
expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;The <i>burra</i>,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;appears both savage and vicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is both, brother, and on that account I bought her;
a savage and vicious beast has generally four excellent
legs.&nbsp; You are a <i>Cal&oacute;</i>, brother, and can manage
her; you shall therefore purchase the savage <i>burra</i>, giving
my daughter Antonia a <i>baria</i> of gold.&nbsp; If you think
fit, you can sell the beast at Talavera or Madrid, for
Estremenian <i>bestis</i> are highly considered in
<i>Castumba</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than an hour I was on the other side of the pass,
mounted on the savage <i>burra</i>.</p>

145</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Pass of Mirabete&mdash;Wolves and
Shepherds&mdash;Female Subtlety&mdash;Death by Wolves&mdash;The
Mystery solved&mdash;The Mountains&mdash;The Dark Hour&mdash;The
Traveller of the Night&mdash;Abarbenel&mdash;Hoarded
Treasure&mdash;Force of Gold&mdash;The Archbishop&mdash;Arrival
at Madrid.</p>
<p>I proceeded down the pass of Mirabete, occasionally ruminating
on the matter which had brought me to Spain, and occasionally
admiring one of the finest prospects in the world.&nbsp; Before
me outstretched lay immense plains, bounded in the distance by
huge mountains, whilst at the foot of the hill which I was now
descending rolled the Tagus, in a deep narrow stream, between
lofty banks; the whole was gilded by the rays of the setting sun,
for the day, though cold and wintry, was bright and clear.&nbsp;
In about an hour I reached the river at a place where stood the
remains of what had once been a magnificent bridge, which had,
however, been blown up in the Peninsular war and never since
repaired.</p>
<p>I crossed the river in a ferry-boat; the passage was rather
difficult, the current very rapid and swollen, owing to the
latter rains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I in New Castile?&rdquo; I demanded of the ferryman,
on reaching the further bank.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>raya</i> is <a
name="page1_146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>many
leagues from hence,&rdquo; replied the ferryman; &ldquo;you seem
a stranger.&nbsp; Whence do you come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
England,&rdquo; I replied, and without waiting for an answer, I
sprang on the <i>burra</i>, and proceeded on my way.&nbsp; The
<i>burra</i> plied her feet most nimbly, and shortly after
nightfall, brought me to a village at about two leagues&rsquo;
distance from the river&rsquo;s bank.</p>
<p>I sat down in the <i>venta</i> where I put up; there was a
huge fire, consisting of the greater part of the trunk of an
olive-tree.&nbsp; The company was rather miscellaneous: a hunter
with his <i>escopeta</i>; a brace of shepherds with immense dogs,
of that species for which Estremadura <a
name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a> is celebrated; a broken soldier, just
returned from the wars; and a beggar, who, after demanding
charity for the seven wounds of <i>Maria Sant&iacute;sima</i>,
took a seat amidst us, and made himself quite comfortable.&nbsp;
The hostess was an active, bustling woman, and busied herself in
cooking my supper, which consisted of the game which I had
purchased at Jaraicejo, and which, on my taking leave of the
gypsy, he had counselled me to take with me.&nbsp; In the mean
time, I sat by the fire listening to the conversation of the
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would I were a wolf,&rdquo; said one of the
shepherds; &ldquo;or, indeed, anything rather than what I
am.&nbsp; A pretty life is this of ours, out in the <i>campo</i>,
among the <i>carrascales</i>, suffering heat and cold for a
<i>peseta</i> a day.&nbsp; I would I were a wolf; he fares
better, and is more respected than the wretch of a
shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he frequently fares scurvily,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;the <a name="page1_147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>shepherd and dogs fall upon him, and then he pays for
his temerity with the loss of his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not often the case, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>
traveller,&rdquo; said the shepherd; &ldquo;he watches his
opportunity, and seldom runs into harm&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; And as
to attacking him, it is no very pleasant task; he has both teeth
and claws, and dog or man, who has once felt them, likes not to
venture a second time within his reach.&nbsp; These dogs of mine
will seize a bear singly with considerable alacrity, though he is
a most powerful animal; but I have seen them run howling away
from a wolf, even though there were two or three of us at hand to
encourage them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dangerous person is the wolf,&rdquo; said the other
shepherd, &ldquo;and cunning as dangerous.&nbsp; Who knows more
than he?&nbsp; He knows the vulnerable point of every animal;
see, for example, how he flies at the neck of a bullock, tearing
open the veins with his grim teeth and claws.&nbsp; But does he
attack a horse in this manner?&nbsp; I trow not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said the other shepherd, &ldquo;he is
too good a judge; but he fastens on the haunches, and hamstrings
him in a moment.&nbsp; Oh, the fear of the horse when he comes
near the dwelling of the wolf!&nbsp; My master was the other day
riding in the <i>despoblado</i>, above the pass, on his fine
Andalusian steed, which had cost him five hundred dollars.&nbsp;
Suddenly the horse stopped, and sweated and trembled like a woman
in the act of fainting.&nbsp; My master could not conceive the
reason, but presently he heard a squealing and growling in the
bushes, whereupon he fired off his gun and scared the wolves, who
scampered away; but he tells me, that the horse has not yet
recovered from his fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the mares know, occasionally, how to balk <a
name="page1_148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>him,&rdquo; replied his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is great craft and malice in mares, as there is in all
females.&nbsp; See them feeding in the <i>campo</i> with their
young <i>cria</i> about them; presently the alarm is given that
the wolf is drawing near; they start wildly and run about for a
moment, but it is only for a moment&mdash;amain they gather
together, forming themselves into a circle, in the centre of
which they place the foals.&nbsp; Onward comes the wolf, hoping
to make his dinner on horseflesh.&nbsp; He is mistaken, however;
the mares have balked him, and are as cunning as himself.&nbsp;
Not a tail is to be seen&mdash;not a hinder quarter&mdash;but
there stand the whole troop, their fronts towards him ready to
receive him, and as he runs round them barking and howling, they
rise successively on their hind legs, ready to stamp him to the
earth, should he attempt to hurt their <i>cria</i> or
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than the he-wolf,&rdquo; said the soldier,
&ldquo;is the female; for, as the <i>se&ntilde;or pastor</i> has
well observed, there is more malice in women than in males.&nbsp;
To see one of these she-demons with a troop of the males at her
heels is truly surprising: where she turns they turn, and what
she does that do they; for they appear bewitched, and have no
power but to imitate her actions.&nbsp; I was once travelling
with a comrade over the hills of Galicia, when we heard a
howl.&nbsp; &lsquo;Those are wolves,&rsquo; said my companion;
&lsquo;let us get out of the way.&rsquo;&nbsp; So we stepped from
the path and ascended the side of the hill a little way, to a
terrace, where grew vines, after the manner of Galicia.&nbsp;
Presently appeared a large grey she-wolf, <i>deshonesta</i>,
snapping and growling at a troop of demons, who followed close
behind, their tails uplifted, and their eyes like
firebrands.&nbsp; What do you think the perverse brute did?&nbsp;
Instead <a name="page1_149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>of keeping to the path, she turned in the very
direction in which we were; there was now no remedy, so we stood
still.&nbsp; I was the first upon the terrace, and by me she
passed so close that I felt her hair brush against my legs; she,
however, took no notice of me, but pushed on, neither looking to
the right nor left, and all the other wolves trotted by me
without offering the slightest injury, or even so much as looking
at me.&nbsp; Would that I could say as much for my poor
companion, who stood farther on, and was, I believe, less in the
demon&rsquo;s way than I was; she had nearly passed him, when
suddenly she turned half round and snapped at him.&nbsp; I shall
never forget what followed: in a moment a dozen wolves were upon
him, tearing him limb from limb, with howlings like nothing in
this world.&nbsp; In a few moments he was devoured; nothing
remained but the skull and a few bones; and then they passed on
in the same manner as they came.&nbsp; Good reason had I to be
grateful that my lady wolf took less notice of me than my poor
comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to this and similar conversation, I fell into a doze
before the fire, in which I continued for a considerable time,
but was at length roused by a voice exclaiming in a loud tone,
&ldquo;All are captured!&rdquo;&nbsp; These were the exact words
which, when spoken by his daughter, confounded the gypsy upon the
moor.&nbsp; I looked around me.&nbsp; The company consisted of
the same individuals to whose conversation I had been listening
before I sank into slumber; but the beggar was now the spokesman,
and he was haranguing with considerable vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, <i>Caballero</i>&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but I did not hear the commencement of your
discourse.&nbsp; Who are those who have been captured?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;A band of accursed <i>Gitanos</i>,
<i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; replied the beggar, returning the title
of courtesy which I had bestowed upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;During
more than a fortnight they have infested the roads on the
frontier of Castile, and many have been the gentlemen travellers
like yourself whom they have robbed and murdered.&nbsp; It would
seem that the gypsy <i>canaille</i> must needs take advantage of
these troublous times, and form themselves into a faction.&nbsp;
It is said that the fellows of whom I am speaking expected many
more of their brethren to join them, which is likely enough, for
all gypsies are thieves: but praised be God, they have been put
down before they became too formidable.&nbsp; I saw them myself
conveyed to the prison at ---.&nbsp; Thanks be to God.&nbsp;
<i>Todos estan presos</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation150a"></a><a
href="#footnote150a" class="citation">[150a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery is now solved,&rdquo; said I to myself, and
proceeded to despatch my supper, which was now ready.</p>
<p>The next day&rsquo;s journey brought me to a considerable
town, the name of which I have forgotten.&nbsp; It is the first
in New Castile, in this direction. <a name="citation150b"></a><a
href="#footnote150b" class="citation">[150b]</a>&nbsp; I passed
the night as usual in the manger of the stable, close beside the
<i>caballeria</i>; for, as I travelled upon a donkey, I deemed it
incumbent upon me to be satisfied with a couch in keeping with my
manner of journeying, being averse, by any squeamish and
over-delicate airs, to generate a suspicion amongst the people
with whom I mingled that I was aught higher than what my equipage
and outward appearance might lead them to believe.&nbsp; Rising
before daylight, I again proceeded on my way, hoping ere night to
be able to reach <a name="page1_151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Talavera, which I was informed was ten leagues
distant.&nbsp; The way lay entirely over an unbroken level, for
the most part covered with olive-trees.&nbsp; On the left,
however, at the distance of a few leagues, rose the mighty
mountains which I have already mentioned.&nbsp; They run eastward
in a seemingly interminable range, parallel with the route which
I was pursuing; their tops and sides were covered with dazzling
snow, and the blasts which came sweeping from them across the
wide and melancholy plains were of bitter keenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mountains are those?&rdquo; I inquired of a
barber-surgeon who, mounted like myself on a grey <i>burra</i>,
joined me about noon, and proceeded in my company for several
leagues.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have many names,
<i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; replied the barber; &ldquo;according to
the names of the neighbouring places, so they are called.&nbsp;
Yon portion of them is styled the Serrania of Plasencia; and
opposite to Madrid they are termed the Mountains of Guadarrama,
from a river of that name, which descends from them.&nbsp; They
run a vast way, <i>Caballero</i>, and separate the two kingdoms,
for on the other side is Old Castile.&nbsp; They are mighty
mountains, and, though they generate much cold, I take pleasure
in looking at them, which is not to be wondered at, seeing that I
was born amongst them, though at present, for my sins, I live in
a village of the plain.&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>, there is not
another such range in Spain; they have their secrets,
too&mdash;their mysteries.&nbsp; Strange tales are told of those
hills, and of what they contain in their deep recesses, for they
are a broad chain, and you may wander days and days amongst them
without coming to any <i>termino</i>.&nbsp; Many have lost
themselves on those hills, and have never again been heard
of.&nbsp; Strange things are told of them: it is said that in
certain <a name="page1_152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>places there are deep pools and lakes, in which dwell
monsters, huge serpents as long as a pine-tree, and horses of the
flood, which sometimes come out and commit mighty damage.&nbsp;
One thing is certain, that yonder, far away to the west, in the
heart of those hills, there is a wonderful valley, so narrow that
only at mid-day is the face of the sun to be descried from
it.&nbsp; That valley lay undiscovered and unknown for thousands
of years; no person dreamed of its existence.&nbsp; But at last,
a long time ago, certain hunters entered it by chance, and then
what do you think they found, <i>Caballero</i>?&nbsp; They found
a small nation or tribe of unknown people, speaking an unknown
language, who, perhaps, had lived there since the creation of the
world, without intercourse with the rest of their
fellow-creatures, and without knowing that other beings besides
themselves existed!&nbsp; <i>Caballero</i>, did you never hear of
the valley of the Batuecas? <a name="citation152"></a><a
href="#footnote152" class="citation">[152]</a>&nbsp; Many books
have been written about that valley and those people.&nbsp;
<i>Caballero</i>, I am proud of yonder hills; and were I
independent, and without wife or children, I would purchase a
<i>burra</i> like that of your own&mdash;which I see is an
excellent one, and far superior to mine&mdash;and travel amongst
them till I knew all their mysteries, and had seen all the
wondrous things which they contain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Throughout the day I pressed the <i>burra</i> forward,
only stopping once in order to feed the animal; but,
notwithstanding that she played her part very well, night came
on, and I was still about two leagues from Talavera.&nbsp; As the
sun went down, the cold became intense; I drew the old gypsy
cloak, which I still wore, closer around me, but I found it quite
inadequate to protect me from the inclemency of the
atmosphere.&nbsp; The road, which lay over a plain, was not very
distinctly traced, and became in the dusk rather difficult to
find, more especially as cross-roads leading to different places
were of frequent occurrence.&nbsp; I, however, proceeded in the
best manner I could, and when I became dubious as to the course
which I should take, I invariably allowed the animal on which I
was mounted to decide.&nbsp; At length the moon shone out
faintly, when suddenly by its beams I beheld a figure moving
before me at a slight distance.&nbsp; I quickened the pace of the
<i>burra</i>, and was soon close at its side.&nbsp; It went on,
neither altering its pace nor looking round for a moment.&nbsp;
It was the figure of a man, the tallest and bulkiest that I had
hitherto seen in Spain, dressed in a manner strange and singular
for the country.&nbsp; On his head was a hat with a low crown and
broad brim, very much resembling that of an English waggoner;
about his body was a long loose tunic or slop, seemingly of
coarse ticken, <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a> open in front, so as to allow the
interior garments to be occasionally seen.&nbsp; These appeared
to consist of a jerkin and short velveteen pantaloons.&nbsp; I
have said that the brim of the hat was broad, but broad as it
was, it was insufficient to cover an immense bush of coal-black
hair, which, thick and curly, projected on either side.&nbsp;
Over the left shoulder was flung <a name="page1_154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>a kind of satchel, and in the right
hand was held a long staff or pole.</p>
<p>There was something peculiarly strange about the figure; but
what struck me the most was the tranquillity with which it moved
along, taking no heed of me, though of course aware of my
proximity, but looking straight forward along the road, save when
it occasionally raised a huge face and large eyes towards the
moon, which was now shining forth in the eastern quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cold night,&rdquo; said I at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
this the way to Talavera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the way to Talavera, and the night is
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Talavera,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as I
suppose you are yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going thither, so are you,
<i>bueno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tones of the voice which delivered these words were in
their way quite as strange and singular as the figure to which
the voice belonged.&nbsp; They were not exactly the tones of a
Spanish voice, and yet there was something in them that could
hardly be foreign; the pronunciation also was correct, and the
language, though singular, faultless.&nbsp; But I was most struck
with the manner in which the last word, <i>bueno</i>, was
spoken.&nbsp; I had heard something like it before, but where or
when I could by no means remember. <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a>&nbsp; A pause now
ensued, the figure stalking on as before with the most perfect
indifference, and seemingly with no disposition either to seek or
avoid conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;to
travel these roads in the dark?&nbsp; It is said that there are
robbers abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not rather afraid,&rdquo; replied the figure,
&ldquo;to <a name="page1_155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>travel these roads in the dark?&mdash;you who are
ignorant of the country, who are a foreigner, an
Englishman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that you know me to be an Englishman?&rdquo;
demanded I, much surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no difficult matter,&rdquo; replied the figure;
&ldquo;the sound of your voice was enough to tell me
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of voices,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;suppose the
tone of your own voice were to tell me who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it will not do,&rdquo; replied my companion;
&ldquo;you know nothing about me&mdash;you can know nothing about
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not sure of that, my friend; I am acquainted with
many things of which you have little idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por exemplo</i>,&rdquo; said the figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you speak two
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure moved on, seemed to consider a moment and then said
slowly, &ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have two names,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;one for
the house, and the other for the street; both are good, but the
one by which you are called at home is the one which you like
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man walked on about ten paces, in the same manner as he
had previously done; all of a sudden he turned, and taking the
bridle of the <i>burra</i> gently in his hand, stopped her.&nbsp;
I had now a full view of his face and figure, and those huge
features and Herculean form still occasionally revisit me in my
dreams.&nbsp; I see him standing in the moonshine, staring me in
the face with his deep calm eyes.&nbsp; At last he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you then <i>one of us</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was late at night when we arrived at Talavera.&nbsp; We
went to a large gloomy house, which my companion informed me was
the principle <i>posada</i> of the <a name="page1_156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>town.&nbsp; We entered the kitchen,
at the extremity of which a large fire was blazing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pepita,&rdquo; <a name="citation156a"></a><a
href="#footnote156a" class="citation">[156a]</a> said my
companion to a handsome girl who advanced smiling towards us,
&ldquo;a <i>brasero</i> and a private apartment.&nbsp; This
cavalier is a friend of mine, and we shall sup
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were shown to an apartment, in which
were two alcoves containing beds.&nbsp; After supper, which
consisted of the very best, by the order of my companion, we sat
over the <i>brasero</i>, and commenced talking.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of course you have conversed with
Englishmen before, else you could not have recognized me by the
tone of my voice.</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>. <a name="citation156b"></a><a
href="#footnote156b" class="citation">[156b]</a>&mdash;I was a
young lad when the war of the Independence broke out, and there
came to the village in which our family lived an English officer,
in order to teach discipline to the new levies.&nbsp; He was
quartered in my father&rsquo;s house, where he conceived a great
affection for me.&nbsp; On his departure, with the consent of my
father, I attended him through both the Castiles, partly as
companion, partly as domestic.&nbsp; I was with him nearly a
year, when he was suddenly summoned to return to his own
country.&nbsp; He would fain have taken me with him, but to that
my father would by no means consent.&nbsp; It is now five and
twenty years since I last saw an Englishman; but you have seen
how I recognized you, even in the dark night.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what kind of life do you pursue, and
by what means do you obtain support?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;I experience no difficulty.&nbsp; I
live much in the same way as I believe my forefathers lived: <a
name="page1_157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>certainly
as my father did, for his course has been mine.&nbsp; At his
death I took possession of the <i>herencia</i>, for I was his
only child.&nbsp; It was not requisite that I should follow any
business, for my wealth was great; yet, to avoid remark, I
followed that of my father, who was a <i>longanizero</i>.&nbsp; I
have occasionally dealt in wool, but lazily&mdash;lazily&mdash;as
I had no stimulus for exertion.&nbsp; I was, however, successful;
in many instances strangely so; much more than many others who
toiled day and night, and whose whole soul was in the trade.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Have you any children?&nbsp; Are you
married?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;I have no children, though I am
married.&nbsp; I have a wife, and an <i>amiga</i>, or I should
rather say two wives, for I am wedded to both. <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a>&nbsp; I however call one my
<i>amiga</i>, for appearance sake, for I wish to live in quiet,
and am unwilling to offend the prejudices of the surrounding
people.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You say you are wealthy.&nbsp; In what
does your wealth consist?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;In gold and silver, and stones of
price; for I have inherited all the hoards of my
forefathers.&nbsp; The greater part is buried underground;
indeed, I have never examined the tenth part of it.&nbsp; I have
coins of silver and gold older than the times of Ferdinand the
Accursed and Jezebel; <a name="citation157b"></a><a
href="#footnote157b" class="citation">[157b]</a> I have also
large sums employed in usury.&nbsp; We keep ourselves close,
however, and pretend to be poor, miserably so; but <a
name="page1_158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>on
certain occasions, at our festivals, when our gates are barred,
and our savage dogs are let loose in the court, we eat our food
off services such as the Queen of Spain cannot boast of, and wash
our feet in ewers of silver, fashioned and wrought before the
Americas were discovered, though our garments are at all times
coarse, and our food for the most part of the plainest
description.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Are there more of you than yourself and
your two wives?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;There are my two servants, who are
likewise of us&mdash;the one is a youth, and is about to leave,
being betrothed to one at some distance; the other is old: he is
now upon the road, following me with a mule and car.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And whither are you bound at present?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;To Toledo, where I ply my trade
occasionally of <i>longanizero</i>.&nbsp; I love to wander about,
though I seldom stray far from home.&nbsp; Since I left the
Englishman my feet have never once stepped beyond the bounds of
New Castile.&nbsp; I love to visit Toledo, and to think of the
times which have long since departed.&nbsp; I should establish
myself there, were there not so many accursed ones, who look upon
me with an evil eye.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Are you known for what you are?&nbsp; Do
the authorities molest you?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;People of course suspect me to be what
I am; but as I conform outwardly in most respects to their ways,
they do not interfere with me.&nbsp; True it is that sometimes,
when I enter the church to hear the mass, they glare at me over
the left shoulder, as much as to say&mdash;&ldquo;What do you
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And sometimes they cross themselves as I pass
by; but as they go <a name="page1_159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>no further, I do not trouble myself
on that account.&nbsp; With respect to the authorities, they are
not bad friends of mine.&nbsp; Many of the higher class have
borrowed money from me on usury, so that I have them to a certain
extent in my power; and as for the low <i>alguazils</i> and
<i>corchetes</i>, they would do anything to oblige me, in
consideration of a few dollars which I occasionally give them; so
that matters upon the whole go on remarkably well.&nbsp; Of old,
indeed, it was far otherwise; yet, I know not how it was, though
other families suffered much, ours always enjoyed a tolerable
share of tranquillity.&nbsp; The truth is, that our family has
always known how to guide itself wonderfully.&nbsp; I may say
there is much of the wisdom of the snake amongst us.&nbsp; We
have always possessed friends; and with respect to enemies, it is
by no means safe to meddle with us, for it is a rule of our house
never to forgive an injury, and to spare neither trouble nor
expense in bringing ruin and destruction upon the heads of our
evil-doers.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Do the priests interfere with you?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;They let me alone, especially in our
own neighbourhood.&nbsp; Shortly after the death of my father one
hot-headed individual endeavoured to do me an evil turn; but I
soon requited him, causing him to be imprisoned on a charge of
blasphemy, and in prison he remained a long time, till he went
mad and died.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Have you a head in Spain, in whom is
vested the chief authority?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;Not exactly.&nbsp; There are, however,
certain holy families who enjoy much consideration; my own is one
of these&mdash;the chiefest, I may say.&nbsp; My grandsire was a
particularly holy man; and I have <a name="page1_160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>heard my father say, that one night
an archbishop came to his house secretly, merely to have the
satisfaction of kissing his head.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;How can that be?&nbsp; What reverence
could an archbishop entertain for one like yourself or your
grandsire?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;More than you imagine.&nbsp; He was
one of us, at least his father was, and he could never forget
what he had learned with reverence in his infancy.&nbsp; He said
he had tried to forget it, but he could not; that the <i>ruah</i>
was continually upon him, and that even from his childhood he had
borne its terrors with a troubled mind, till at last he could
bear himself no longer; so he went to my grandsire, with whom he
remained one whole night; he then returned to his diocese, where
he shortly afterwards died, in much renown for sanctity.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What you say surprises me.&nbsp; Have you
reason to suppose that many of you are to be found amongst the
priesthood?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;Not to suppose, but to know it.&nbsp;
There are many such as I amongst the priesthood, and not amongst
the inferior priesthood either; some of the most learned and
famed of them in Spain have been of us, or of our blood at least,
and many of them at this day think as I do.&nbsp; There is one
particular festival of the year at which four dignified
ecclesiastics are sure to visit me; and then, when all is made
close and secure, and the fitting ceremonies have been gone
through, they sit down upon the floor and curse.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Are you numerous in the large towns?</p>
<p><i>Abarbenel</i>.&mdash;By no means; our places of abode are
seldom the large towns; we prefer the villages, and rarely enter
the large towns but on business.&nbsp; Indeed, <a
name="page1_161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>we are
not a numerous people, and there are few provinces of Spain which
contain more than twenty families.&nbsp; None of us are poor, and
those among us who serve, do so more from choice than necessity,
for by serving each other we acquire different trades.&nbsp; Not
unfrequently the time of service is that of courtship also, and
the servants eventually marry the daughters of the house.</p>
<p>We continued in discourse the greater part of the night; the
next morning I prepared to depart.&nbsp; My companion, however,
advised me to remain where I was for that day.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
if you respect my counsel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will not
proceed farther in this manner.&nbsp; To-night the diligence will
arrive from Estremadura, on its way to Madrid.&nbsp; Deposit
yourself therein; it is the safest and most speedy mode of
travelling.&nbsp; As for your animal, I will myself purchase
her.&nbsp; My servant is here, and has informed me that she will
be of service to us.&nbsp; Let us, therefore, pass the day
together in communion, like brothers, and then proceed on our
separate journeys.&rdquo;&nbsp; We did pass the day together; and
when the diligence arrived I deposited myself within, and on the
morning of the second day arrived at Madrid.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Lodging at Madrid&mdash;My
Hostess&mdash;British
Ambassador&mdash;Mendizabal&mdash;Baltasar&mdash;Duties of a
National&mdash;Young Blood&mdash;The Execution&mdash;Population
of Madrid&mdash;The Higher Orders&mdash;The Lower
Classes&mdash;The Bull-fighter&mdash;The Crabbed Gitano.</p>
<p>It was the commencement of February, 1837, when I reached
Madrid.&nbsp; After staying a few days at a <i>posada</i>, I
removed to a lodging which I engaged at No. 3, in the Calle de la
Zarza, <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a> a dark dirty street, which, however,
was close to the Puerta del Sol, the most central point of
Madrid, into which four or five of the principal streets
debouche, and which is, at all times of the year, the great place
of assemblage for the idlers of the capital, poor or rich.</p>
<p>It was rather a singular house in which I had taken up my
abode.&nbsp; I occupied the front part of the first floor; my
apartments consisted of an immense parlour, and a small chamber
on one side in which I slept.&nbsp; The parlour, notwithstanding
its size, contained very little furniture: a few chairs, a table,
and a species of sofa, constituted the whole.&nbsp; It was very
cold and airy, owing to the draughts which poured in from three
large windows, and from sundry doors.&nbsp; The mistress of the
house, attended by her two daughters, ushered <a
name="page1_163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>me
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever see a more magnificent
apartment?&rdquo; demanded the former; &ldquo;is it not fit for a
king&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; Last winter it was occupied by the great
General Espartero.&rdquo; <a name="citation163"></a><a
href="#footnote163" class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<p>The hostess was an exceedingly fat woman, a native of
Valladolid, in Old Castile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any other
family,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;besides these
daughters?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Two sons,&rdquo; she replied;
&ldquo;one of them an officer in the army, father of this
urchin,&rdquo; pointing to a wicked but clever-looking boy of
about twelve, who at that moment bounded into the room;
&ldquo;the other is the most celebrated national in Madrid.&nbsp;
He is a tailor by trade, and his name is Baltasar.&nbsp; He has
much influence with the other nationals, on account of the
liberality of his opinions, and a word from him is sufficient to
bring them all out armed and furious to the Puerta del Sol.&nbsp;
He is, however, at present confined to his bed, for he is very
dissipated, and fond of the company of bullfighters and people
still worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As my principal motive for visiting the Spanish capital was
the hope of obtaining permission from the government to print the
New Testament in the Castilian language, for circulation in
Spain, I lost no time, upon my arrival, in taking what I
considered to be the necessary steps.</p>
<p>I was an entire stranger at Madrid, and bore no letters of
introduction to any persons of influence who might have assisted
me in this undertaking, so that, notwithstanding I entertained a
hope of success, relying on the assistance of the Almighty, this
hope was not at all times very vivid, but was frequently overcast
with the clouds of despondency.</p>
<p><a name="page1_164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Mendizabal <a name="citation164a"></a><a
href="#footnote164a" class="citation">[164a]</a> was at this time
prime minister of Spain, and was considered as a man of almost
unbounded power, in whose hands were placed the destinies of the
country.&nbsp; I therefore considered that if I could by any
means induce him to favour my views, I should have no reason to
fear interruption from other quarters, and I determined upon
applying to him.</p>
<p>Before taking this step, however, I deemed it advisable to
wait upon Mr. Villiers, <a name="citation164b"></a><a
href="#footnote164b" class="citation">[164b]</a> the British
ambassador at Madrid, and, with the freedom permitted to a
British subject, to ask his advice in this affair.&nbsp; I was
received with great kindness, and enjoyed a conversation with him
on various subjects before I introduced the matter which I had
most at heart.&nbsp; He said that if I wished for an interview
with Mendizabal he would endeavour to procure me one, but, at the
same time, told me frankly that he could not hope that any good
would arise from it, as he knew him to be violently prejudiced
against the British and Foreign Bible Society, and was far more
likely to discountenance than encourage any efforts which they
might be disposed <a name="page1_165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>to make for introducing the Gospel
into Spain.&nbsp; I, however, remained resolute in my desire to
make the trial, and before I left him obtained a letter of
introduction to Mendizabal.</p>
<p>Early one morning I repaired to the palace, in a wing of which
was the office of the prime minister.&nbsp; It was bitterly cold,
and the Guadarrama, of which there is a noble view from the
palace plain, was covered with snow.&nbsp; For at least three
hours I remained shivering with cold in an anteroom, with several
other aspirants for an interview with the man of power.&nbsp; At
last his private secretary made his appearance, and after putting
various questions to the others, addressed himself to me, asking
who I was and what I wanted.&nbsp; I told him that I was an
Englishman, and the bearer of a letter from the British
Minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you have no objection, I will myself
deliver it to his Excellency,&rdquo; said he; whereupon I handed
it to him, and he withdrew.&nbsp; Several individuals were
admitted before me; at last, however, my own turn came, and I was
ushered into the presence of Mendizabal.</p>
<p>He stood behind a table covered with papers, on which his eyes
were intently fixed.&nbsp; He took not the slightest notice when
I entered, and I had leisure enough to survey him.&nbsp; He was a
huge athletic man, somewhat taller than myself, who measure six
feet two without my shoes.&nbsp; His complexion was florid, his
features fine and regular, his nose quite aquiline, and his teeth
splendidly white; though scarcely fifty years of age, his hair
was remarkably grey.&nbsp; He was dressed in a rich morning gown,
with a gold chain round his neck, and morocco slippers on his
feet.</p>
<p>His secretary, a fine intellectual-looking man, who, as I was
subsequently informed, had acquired a name <a
name="page1_166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>both in
English and Spanish literature, <a name="citation166a"></a><a
href="#footnote166a" class="citation">[166a]</a> stood at one end
of the table with papers in his hands.</p>
<p>After I had been standing about a quarter of an hour,
Mendizabal suddenly lifted up a pair of sharp eyes, and fixed
them upon me with a peculiarly scrutinizing glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a glance very similar to that amongst the
Beni Israel,&rdquo; <a name="citation166b"></a><a
href="#footnote166b" class="citation">[166b]</a> thought I to
myself. . . .</p>
<p>My interview with him lasted nearly an hour.&nbsp; Some
singular discourse passed between us.&nbsp; I found him, as I had
been informed, a bitter enemy to the Bible Society, of which he
spoke in terms of hatred and contempt; and by no means a friend
to the Christian religion, which I could easily account
for.&nbsp; I was not discouraged, however, and pressed upon him
the matter which brought me thither, and was eventually so far
successful as to obtain a promise, that at the expiration of a
few months, when he hoped the country would be in a more tranquil
state, I should be allowed to print the Scriptures.</p>
<p>As I was going away he said, &ldquo;Yours is not the first
application I have had: ever since I have held the reins of
government I have been pestered in this manner by English,
calling themselves Evangelical Christians, who have of late come
flocking over into Spain.&nbsp; Only last week a hunchbacked
fellow found his way into my cabinet whilst I was engaged in
important business, and told me that Christ was coming. . .
.&nbsp; And now you have made your appearance, and almost
persuaded me to embroil myself yet more with the priesthood, as
if they did not abhor me enough <a name="page1_167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>already.&nbsp; What a strange
infatuation is this which drives you over lands and waters with
Bibles in your hands!&nbsp; My good sir, it is not Bibles we
want, but rather guns and gunpowder to put the rebels down with,
and, above all, money, that we may pay the troops.&nbsp; Whenever
you come with these three things you shall have a hearty welcome;
if not, we really can dispense with your visits, however great
the honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;There will be no end to the troubles of
this afflicted country until the Gospel have free
circulation.</p>
<p><i>Mendizabal</i>.&mdash;I expected that answer, for I have
not lived thirteen years in England without forming some
acquaintance with the phraseology of you good folks.&nbsp; Now,
now, pray go; you see how engaged I am.&nbsp; Come again whenever
you please, but let it not be within the next three months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said my hostess, coming into
my apartment one morning, whilst I sat at breakfast, with my feet
upon the <i>brasero</i>, &ldquo;here is my son Baltasarito, the
national.&nbsp; He has risen from his bed, and hearing that there
is an Englishman in the house, he has begged me to introduce him,
for he loves Englishmen on account of the liberality of their
opinions.&nbsp; There he is; what do you think of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not state to his mother what I thought; it appeared to
me, however, that she was quite right in calling him Baltasarito,
which is the diminutive of Baltasar, forasmuch as that ancient
and sonorous name had certainly never been bestowed on a more
diminutive personage.&nbsp; He might measure about five feet one
inch, though he was rather corpulent for his height; his face
looked yellow and sickly; he had, however, a kind of
fanfaronading air, and his eyes, which were <a
name="page1_168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of dark
brown, were both sharp and brilliant.&nbsp; His dress, or rather
his undress, was somewhat shabby: he had a foraging cap on his
head, and in lieu of a morning gown he wore a sentinel&rsquo;s
old great-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to make your acquaintance, <i>se&ntilde;or
nacional</i>,&rdquo; said I to him, after his mother had departed
and Baltasar had taken his seat, and of course lighted a paper
cigar <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a> at the <i>brasero</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am glad to have made your acquaintance, more especially as your
lady-mother has informed me that you have great influence with
the nationals.&nbsp; I am a stranger in Spain, and may want a
friend; fortune has been kind to me in procuring me one who is a
member of so powerful a body.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Baltasar</i>.&mdash;Yes, I have a great deal to say with
the other nationals; there is none in Madrid better known than
Baltasar, or more dreaded by the Carlists.&nbsp; You say you may
stand in need of a friend; there is no fear of my failing you in
any emergency.&nbsp; Both myself and any of the other nationals
will be proud to go out with you as <i>padrinos</i>, should you
have any affair of honour on your hands.&nbsp; But why do you not
become one of us?&nbsp; We would gladly receive you into our
body.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Is the duty of a national particularly
hard?</p>
<p><i>Baltasar</i>.&mdash;By no means.&nbsp; We have to do duty
about once every fifteen days, and then there is occasionally a
review, which does not last long.&nbsp; No! the duties of a
national are by no means onerous, and the privileges are
great.&nbsp; I have seen three of my brother nationals walk up
and down the Prado of a Sunday, <a name="page1_169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>with sticks in their hands,
cudgelling all the suspicious characters; and it is our common
practice to scour the streets at night, and then if we meet any
person who is obnoxious to us, we fall upon him, and with a knife
or a bayonet generally leave him wallowing in his blood on the
pavement.&nbsp; No one but a national would be permitted to do
that.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of course none but persons of liberal
opinions are to be found amongst the nationals?</p>
<p><i>Baltasar</i>.&mdash;Would it were so!&nbsp; There are some
amongst us, <i>Don Jorge</i>, who are no better than they should
be; they are few, however, and for the most part well
known.&nbsp; Theirs is no pleasant life, for when they mount
guard with the rest they are scouted, and not unfrequently
cudgelled.&nbsp; The law compels all of a certain age either to
serve in the army or to become national soldiers, on which
account some of these <i>Godos</i> are to be found amongst
us.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Are there many in Madrid of the Carlist
opinion?</p>
<p><i>Baltasar</i>.&mdash;Not among the young people; the greater
part of the Madrilenian Carlists capable of bearing arms departed
long ago to join the ranks of the factious in the Basque
provinces.&nbsp; Those who remain are for the most part
greybeards and priests, good for nothing but to assemble in
private coffee-houses, and to prate treason together.&nbsp; Let
them prate, <i>Don Jorge</i>; let them prate; the destinies of
Spain do not depend on the wishes of <i>ojalateros</i> and
<i>pasteleros</i>, <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a> but on the hands
of stout, gallant nationals, like myself and friends, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page1_170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I am sorry to learn from your
lady-mother that you are strangely dissipated.</p>
<p><i>Baltasar</i>.&mdash;Ho, ho, <i>Don Jorge</i>, she has told
you that, has she?&nbsp; What would you have, <i>Don
Jorge</i>?&nbsp; I am young, and young blood will have its
course.&nbsp; I am called Baltasar the gay by all the other
nationals, and it is on account of my gaiety and the liberality
of my opinions that I am so popular among them.&nbsp; When I
mount guard I invariably carry my guitar with me, and then there
is sure to be a <i>funcion</i> at the guard-house.&nbsp; We send
for wine, <i>Don Jorge</i>, and the nationals become wild, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, dancing and drinking through the night, whilst
Baltasarito strums the guitar and sings them songs of
<i>German&iacute;a</i>:&mdash; <a name="citation170a"></a><a
href="#footnote170a" class="citation">[170a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Una rom&iacute; sin pach&iacute;<br />
Le pen&oacute; &aacute; su chindomar,&rdquo; <a
name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a> etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is <i>Gitano</i>, <i>Don Jorge</i>; I learnt it from the
<i>toreros</i> of Andalusia, who all speak <i>Gitano</i>, and are
mostly of gypsy blood.&nbsp; I learnt it from them; they are all
friends of mine, Montes, Sevilla, and Poquito Pan. <a
name="citation170c"></a><a href="#footnote170c"
class="citation">[170c]</a>&nbsp; I never miss a <i>funcion</i>
of bulls, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; Baltasar is sure to be there
with his <i>amiga</i>.&nbsp; <i>Don Jorge</i>, there are no
bull-funcions in the winter, or I would carry you to one, but
happily to-morrow there <a name="page1_171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>is an execution, a <i>funcion de la
horca</i>; <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> and there we will go, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.</p>
<p>We did go to see this execution, which I shall long
remember.&nbsp; The criminals were two young men, brothers; they
suffered for a most atrocious murder, having in the dead of night
broken open the house of an aged man, whom they put to death, and
whose property they stole.&nbsp; Criminals in Spain are not
hanged as they are in England, or guillotined as in France, but
strangled upon a wooden stage.&nbsp; They sit down on a kind of
chair with a post behind, to which is affixed an iron collar with
a screw; this iron collar is made to clasp the neck of the
prisoner, and on a certain signal it is drawn tighter and tighter
by means of the screw, until life becomes extinct.&nbsp; After we
had waited amongst the assembled multitude a considerable time,
the first of the culprits appeared; he was mounted on an ass
without saddle or stirrups, his legs being allowed to dangle
nearly to the ground.&nbsp; He was dressed in yellow,
sulphur-coloured robes, with a high-peaked conical red hat on his
head, which was shaven.&nbsp; Between his hands he held a
parchment, on which was written something&mdash;I believe the
confession of faith.&nbsp; Two priests led the animal by the
bridle; two others walked on either side, chanting litanies,
amongst which I distinguished the words of heavenly peace and
tranquillity, for the culprit had been reconciled to the church,
had confessed and received absolution, and had been promised
admission to heaven.&nbsp; He did not exhibit the least symptom
of fear, but dismounted from the animal and was led, not
supported, up the scaffold, where he was placed on the chair, <a
name="page1_172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>and the
fatal collar put round his neck.&nbsp; One of the priests then in
a loud voice commenced saying the Belief, and the culprit
repeated the words after him.&nbsp; On a sudden, the executioner,
who stood behind, commenced turning the screw, which was of
prodigious force, and the wretched man was almost instantly a
corpse; but, as the screw went round, the priest began to shout,
&ldquo;<i>pax et misericordia et tranquillitas</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172"
class="citation">[172]</a> and still as he shouted, his voice
became louder and louder, till the lofty walls of Madrid rang
with it.&nbsp; Then stooping down, he placed his mouth close to
the culprit&rsquo;s ear, still shouting, just as if he would
pursue the spirit through its course to eternity, cheering it on
its way.&nbsp; The effect was tremendous.&nbsp; I myself was so
excited that I involuntarily shouted,
&ldquo;<i>Misericordia</i>,&rdquo; and so did many others.&nbsp;
God was not thought of; Christ was not thought of; only the
priest was thought of, for he seemed at that moment to be the
first being in existence, and to have the power of opening and
shutting the gates of heaven or of hell, just as he should think
proper&mdash;a striking instance of the successful working of the
Popish system, whose grand aim has ever been to keep
people&rsquo;s minds as far as possible from God, and to centre
their hopes and fears in the priesthood.&nbsp; The execution of
the second culprit was precisely similar; he ascended the
scaffold a few minutes after his brother had breathed his
last.</p>
<p>I have visited most of the principal capitals of the world,
but upon the whole none has ever so interested me as this city of
Madrid, in which I now found myself.&nbsp; I will not dwell upon
its streets, its edifices, its public squares, its fountains,
though some of these are remarkable enough; but Petersburg has
finer streets, <a name="page1_173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Paris and Edinburgh more stately edifices, London far
nobler squares, whilst Shiraz can boast of more costly fountains,
though not cooler waters.&nbsp; But the population!&nbsp; Within
a mud wall scarcely one league and a half in circuit, are
contained two hundred thousand human beings, certainly forming
the most extraordinary vital mass to be found in the entire
world; and be it always remembered that this mass is strictly
Spanish.&nbsp; The population of Constantinople is extraordinary
enough, but to form it twenty nations have
contributed&mdash;Greeks, Armenians, Persians, Poles, Jews, the
latter, by-the-by, of Spanish origin, and speaking amongst
themselves the old Spanish language; but the huge population of
Madrid, with the exception of a sprinkling of foreigners, chiefly
French tailors, glove-makers, and <i>perruquiers</i>, is strictly
Spanish, though a considerable portion are not natives of the
place.&nbsp; Here are no colonies of Germans, as at Saint
Petersburg; no English factories, as at Lisbon; no multitudes of
insolent Yankees lounging through the streets, as at the
Havannah, with an air which seems to say, &ldquo;The land is our
own whenever we choose to take it;&rdquo; but a population which,
however strange and wild, and composed of various elements, is
Spanish, and will remain so as long as the city itself shall
exist.&nbsp; Hail, ye <i>aguadores</i> of Asturia! who, in your
dress of coarse duffel and leathern skull-caps, are seen seated
in hundreds by the fountain sides, upon your empty water-casks,
or staggering with them filled to the topmost stories of lofty
houses.&nbsp; Hail, ye <i>caleseros</i> of Valencia! who, lolling
lazily against your vehicles, rasp tobacco for your paper cigars
whilst waiting for a fare.&nbsp; Hail to you, beggars of La
Mancha! men and women, who, wrapped in coarse blankets, demand
charity indifferently at the <a name="page1_174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>gate of the palace or the
prison.&nbsp; Hail to you, valets from the mountains,
<i>mayordomos</i> and secretaries from Biscay and Guipuzcoa,
<i>toreros</i> from Andalusia, <i>reposteros</i> from Galicia,
shopkeepers from Catalonia!&nbsp; Hail to ye, Castilians,
Estremenians, and Aragonese, of whatever calling!&nbsp; And
lastly, genuine sons of the capital, rabble of Madrid, ye twenty
thousand <i>manolos</i>, <a name="citation174a"></a><a
href="#footnote174a" class="citation">[174a]</a> whose terrible
knives, on the second morning of May, <a
name="citation174b"></a><a href="#footnote174b"
class="citation">[174b]</a> worked such grim havoc amongst the
legions of Murat!</p>
<p>And the higher orders&mdash;the ladies and gentlemen, the
cavaliers and <i>se&ntilde;oras</i>&mdash;shall I pass them by in
silence?&nbsp; The truth is I have little to say about them; I
mingled but little in their society, and what I saw of them by no
means tended to exalt them in my imagination.&nbsp; I am not one
of those who, wherever they go, make it a constant practice to
disparage the higher orders, and to exalt the populace at their
expense.&nbsp; There are many capitals in which the high
aristocracy, the lords and ladies, the sons and daughters of
nobility, constitute the most remarkable and the most interesting
part of the population.&nbsp; This is the case at Vienna, and
more especially at London.&nbsp; Who can rival the English
aristocrat in lofty stature, in dignified bearing, in strength of
hand, and valour of heart?&nbsp; Who rides a nobler horse?&nbsp;
Who has a firmer seat?&nbsp; And who more lovely than his wife,
or sister, or daughter?&nbsp; But with respect to the Spanish
aristocracy, the ladies and gentlemen, the cavaliers and
<i>se&ntilde;oras</i>, I believe the <a
name="page1_175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>less that
is said of them on the points to which I have just alluded the
better.&nbsp; I confess, however, that I know little about them;
they have, perhaps, their admirers, and to the pens of such I
leave their panegyric.&nbsp; Le Sage has described them as they
were nearly two centuries ago.&nbsp; His description is anything
but captivating, and I do not think that they have improved since
the period of the sketches of the immortal Frenchman.&nbsp; I
would sooner talk of the lower class, not only of Madrid, but of
all Spain.&nbsp; The Spaniard of the lower class has much more
interest for me, whether <i>manolo</i>, labourer, or
muleteer.&nbsp; He is not a common being; he is an extraordinary
man.&nbsp; He has not, it is true, the amiability and generosity
of the Russian <i>mujik</i>, who will give his only <i>rouble</i>
rather than the stranger shall want; nor his placid courage,
which renders him insensible to fear, and, at the command of his
Tsar, sends him singing to certain death. <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; There is more hardness and less
self-devotion in the disposition of the Spaniard; he possesses,
however, a spirit of proud independence, which it is impossible
but to admire.&nbsp; He is ignorant, of course; but it is
singular, that I have invariably found amongst the low and
slightly educated classes far more liberality of sentiment than
amongst the upper.&nbsp; It has long been the fashion to talk of
the bigotry of the Spaniards, and their mean jealousy of
foreigners.&nbsp; This is true to a certain extent; but it
chiefly holds good with respect to the upper classes.&nbsp; If
foreign valour or talent has never received its proper meed in
Spain, <a name="page1_176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>the great body of the Spaniards are certainly not in
fault.&nbsp; I have heard Wellington calumniated in this proud
scene of his triumphs, but never by the old soldiers of Aragon
and the Asturias, who assisted to vanquish the French at
Salamanca and the Pyrenees.&nbsp; I have heard the manner of
riding of an English jockey criticized, but it was by the idiotic
heir of Medina Celi, and not by a <i>picador</i> of the
Madrilenian bull-ring.</p>
<p>Apropos of bull-fighters:&mdash;Shortly after my arrival, I
one day entered a low tavern in a neighbourhood notorious for
robbery and murder, and in which for the last two hours I had
been wandering on a voyage of discovery.&nbsp; I was fatigued,
and required refreshment.&nbsp; I found the place thronged with
people, who had all the appearance of ruffians.&nbsp; I saluted
them, upon which they made way for me to the bar, taking off
their <i>sombreros</i> with great ceremony.&nbsp; I emptied a
glass of <i>val de pe&ntilde;as</i>, and was about to pay for it
and depart, when a horrible-looking fellow, dressed in a buff
jerkin, leather breeches, and jackboots, which came halfway up
his thighs, and having on his head a white hat, the rims of which
were at least a yard and a half in circumference, pushed through
the crowd, and confronting me, roared:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Otra copita</i>! <i>vamos Inglesito</i>: <i>Otra
copita</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation176"></a><a
href="#footnote176" class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my good sir, you are very kind.&nbsp; You
appear to know me, but I have not the honour of knowing
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know me!&rdquo; replied the being.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am Sevilla, the <i>torero</i>.&nbsp; I know you well; you are the
friend of Baltasarito, the national, who is a friend of mine, and
a very good subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to the company, he said in a sonorous <a
name="page1_177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>tone,
laying a strong emphasis on the last syllable of every word,
according to the custom of the <i>gente rufianesca</i> throughout
Spain&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cavaliers, and strong men, this cavalier is the friend
of a friend of mine.&nbsp; <i>Es mucho hombre</i>. <a
name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a"
class="citation">[177a]</a>&nbsp; There is none like him in
Spain.&nbsp; He speaks the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>, though he is an
<i>Inglesito</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not believe it,&rdquo; replied several grave
voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible, say you?&nbsp; I tell you it
is.&nbsp; Come forward, Balseiro, you who have been in prison all
your life, and are always boasting that you can speak the crabbed
<i>Gitano</i>, though I say you know nothing of it&mdash;come
forward and speak to his worship in the crabbed
<i>Gitano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, slight, but active figure stepped forward.&nbsp; He was
in his shirt-sleeves, and wore a <i>montero</i> cap; <a
name="citation177b"></a><a href="#footnote177b"
class="citation">[177b]</a> his features were handsome, but they
were those of a demon.</p>
<p>He spoke a few words in the broken gypsy slang of the prison,
inquiring of me whether I had ever been in the condemned cell,
and whether I knew what a <i>Gitana</i> <a
name="citation177c"></a><a href="#footnote177c"
class="citation">[177c]</a> was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vamos Inglesito</i>,&rdquo; shouted Sevilla, in a
voice of thunder; &ldquo;answer the <i>monr&oacute;</i> in the
crabbed <i>Gitano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered the robber, for such he was, and one too whose name
will live for many a year in the ruffian histories of Madrid; I
answered him in a speech of <a name="page1_178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>some length, in the dialect of the
Estremenian gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>,&rdquo;
muttered Balseiro.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is either that or English, for
I understand not a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not say to you,&rdquo; cried the bull-fighter,
&ldquo;that you knew nothing of the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>?&nbsp;
But this <i>Inglesito</i> does.&nbsp; I understood all he
said.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>, there is none like him for the crabbed
<i>Gitano</i>.&nbsp; He is a good <i>ginete</i>, too; next to
myself, there is none like him, only he rides with stirrup
leathers too short. <a name="citation178"></a><a
href="#footnote178" class="citation">[178]</a>&nbsp;
<i>Inglesito</i>, if you have need of money, I will lend you my
purse.&nbsp; All I have is at your service, and that is not a
little; I have just gained four thousand <i>chul&eacute;s</i> by
the lottery.&nbsp; Courage, Englishman!&nbsp; Another cup.&nbsp;
I will pay all&mdash;I, Sevilla!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he clapped his hand repeatedly on his breast, reiterating,
&ldquo;I, Sevilla!&nbsp; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

179</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Intrigues at Court&mdash;Quesada and
Galiano&mdash;Dissolution of the Cortes&mdash;The
Secretary&mdash;Aragonese Pertinacity&mdash;The Council of
Trent&mdash;The Asturian&mdash;The Three Thieves&mdash;Benedict
Mol&mdash;The Men of Lucerne&mdash;The Treasure.</p>
<p>Mendizabal had told me to call upon him again at the end of
three months, giving me hopes that he would not then oppose
himself to the publication of the New Testament; before, however,
the three months had elapsed, he had fallen into disgrace, and
had ceased to be prime minister.</p>
<p>An intrigue had been formed against him, at the head of which
were two quondam friends of his, and fellow-townsmen,
Gaditanians, Isturitz, and Alcala Galiano.&nbsp; Both of them had
been egregious liberals in their day, and indeed principal
members of those Cortes which, on the Angoul&ecirc;me invasion,
had hurried Ferdinand from Madrid to Cadiz, and kept him prisoner
there until that impregnable town thought proper to surrender,
and both of them had been subsequently refugees in England, where
they had spent a considerable number of years.</p>
<p>These gentlemen, however, finding themselves about this time
exceedingly poor, and not seeing any immediate prospect of
advantage from supporting Mendizabal&mdash;considering
themselves, moreover, quite as good men as he, and as capable of
governing Spain in the <a name="page1_180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>present emergency&mdash;determined
to secede from the party of their friend, whom they had hitherto
supported, and to set up for themselves.</p>
<p>They therefore formed an opposition to Mendizabal in the
Cortes; the members of this opposition assumed the name of
<i>moderados</i>, in contradistinction to Mendizabal and his
followers, who were ultra-liberals.&nbsp; The <i>moderados</i>
were encouraged by the Queen Regent Christina, who aimed at a
little more power than the liberals were disposed to allow her,
and who had a personal dislike to the minister.&nbsp; They were
likewise encouraged by Cordova, <a name="citation180a"></a><a
href="#footnote180a" class="citation">[180a]</a> who at that time
commanded the army, and was displeased with Mendizabal, inasmuch
as the latter did not supply the pecuniary demands of the general
with sufficient alacrity, though it is said that the greater part
of what was sent for the payment of the troops was not devoted to
that purpose, but was invested in the French funds in the name
and for the use and behoof of the said Cordova.</p>
<p>It is, however, by no means my intention to write an account
of the political events which were passing around me at this
period; suffice it to say that Mendizabal, finding himself
thwarted in all his projects by the Regent and the general, the
former of whom would adopt no measure which he recommended,
whilst the latter remained inactive, and refused to engage the
enemy, which by this time had recovered from the check caused by
the death of Zumalacarregui, <a name="citation180b"></a><a
href="#footnote180b" class="citation">[180b]</a> and <a
name="page1_181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>was
making considerable progress, resigned, and left the field, for
the time, open to his adversaries, though he possessed an immense
majority in the Cortes, and had the voice of the nation, at least
the liberal part of it, in his favour.</p>
<p>Thereupon <a name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a"
class="citation">[181a]</a> Isturitz <a
name="citation181b"></a><a href="#footnote181b"
class="citation">[181b]</a> became head of the cabinet, Galiano
minister of marine, and a certain Duke of Rivas minister of the
interior.&nbsp; These were the heads of the <i>moderado</i>
government; but as they were by no means popular at Madrid, and
feared the nationals, they associated with themselves one who
hated the latter body, and feared nothing, a man of the name of
Quesada&mdash;a very stupid individual, but a great fighter, who,
at one period of his life, had commanded a legion or body of men
called the Army of the Faith, whose exploits, both on the French
and Spanish side of the Pyrenees, are too well known to require
recapitulation.&nbsp; This person was made captain-general of
Madrid. <a name="citation181c"></a><a href="#footnote181c"
class="citation">[181c]</a></p>
<p>By far the most clever member of this government was Galiano,
whose acquaintance I had formed shortly after my arrival.&nbsp;
He was a man of considerable literature, and particularly well
versed in that of his own country.&nbsp; He was, moreover, a
fluent, elegant, and forcible speaker, and was to the
<i>moderado</i> party within the Cortes what Quesada was without,
namely, <a name="page1_182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>their horses and chariots.&nbsp; Why he was made
minister of marine is difficult to say, as Spain did not possess
any; perhaps, however, from his knowledge of the English
language, which he spoke and wrote nearly as well as his own
tongue, having, indeed, during his sojourn in England, chiefly
supported himself by writing for reviews and journals,&mdash;an
honourable occupation, but to which few foreign exiles in England
would be qualified to devote themselves.</p>
<p>He was a very small and irritable man, and a bitter enemy to
every person who stood in the way of his advancement.&nbsp; He
hated Mendizabal with undisguised rancour, and never spoke of him
but in terms of unmeasured contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid
that I shall have some difficulty in inducing Mendizabal to give
me permission to print the Testament,&rdquo; said I to him one
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mendizabal is a jackass,&rdquo; replied
Galiano.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caligula made his horse consul, which I
suppose induced Lord --- to send over this huge <i>burro</i> of
the Stock Exchange to be our minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be very ungrateful, on my part, were I not to confess
my great obligations to Galiano, who assisted me to the utmost of
his power in the business which had brought me to Spain.&nbsp;
Shortly after the ministry was formed, I went to him and said,
&ldquo;that now or never was the time to make an effort in my
behalf.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said he, in a
waspish tone; for he always spoke waspishly whether to friend or
foe; &ldquo;but you must have patience for a few days; we are
very much occupied at present.&nbsp; We have been out-voted in
the Cortes, and this afternoon we intend to dissolve them.&nbsp;
It is believed that the rascals will refuse to depart, but
Quesada will stand at the door ready to turn them out, should
they <a name="page1_183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>prove refractory.&nbsp; Come along, and you will
perhaps see a <i>funcion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an hour&rsquo;s debate, the Cortes were dissolved
without it being necessary to call in the aid of the redoubtable
Quesada, and Galiano forthwith gave me a letter to his colleague,
the Duke of Rivas, in whose department he told me was vested the
power either of giving or refusing the permission to print the
book in question.&nbsp; The duke was a very handsome young man,
of about thirty, an Andalusian by birth, like his two
colleagues.&nbsp; He had published several works&mdash;tragedies,
I believe&mdash;and enjoyed a certain kind of literary
reputation.&nbsp; He received me with the greatest affability;
and having heard what I had to say, he replied with a most
captivating bow, and a genuine Andalusian grimace: &ldquo;Go to
my secretary; go to my secretary&mdash;<i>el har&aacute; por
usted el gusto</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a>&nbsp; So I went to
the secretary, whose name was Oliban, an Aragonese, who was not
handsome, and whose manners were neither elegant nor
affable.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want permission to print the
Testament?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you have come to his Excellency about it?&rdquo;
continued Oliban.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose you intend to print it without
notes?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then his
Excellency cannot give you permission,&rdquo; said the Aragonese
secretary.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was determined by the Council of Trent
that no part of the Scripture should be printed in any Christian
country without the notes of the church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How
many years was that ago?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not
know how many years ago it was,&rdquo; said Oliban; &ldquo;but
such was the decree of the Council of Trent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is Spain at present governed according to the decrees of
the Council of Trent?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;In some
points <a name="page1_184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>she is,&rdquo; answered the Aragonese, &ldquo;and this
is one.&nbsp; But tell me, who are you?&nbsp; Are you known to
the British minister?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, and he takes a
great interest in the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo;
said Oliban; &ldquo;that indeed alters the case: if you can show
me that his Excellency takes an interest in this business, I
certainly shall not oppose myself to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British minister performed all I could wish, and much more
than I could expect.&nbsp; He had an interview with the Duke of
Rivas, with whom he had much discourse upon my affair: the duke
was all smiles and courtesy.&nbsp; He moreover wrote a private
letter to the duke, which he advised me to present when I next
paid him a visit; and, to crown all, he wrote a letter directed
to myself, in which he did me the honour to say, that he had a
regard for me, and that nothing would afford him greater pleasure
than to hear that I had obtained the permission which I was
seeking.&nbsp; So I went to the duke, and delivered the
letter.&nbsp; He was ten times more kind and affable than before:
he read the letter, smiled most sweetly, and then, as if seized
with sudden enthusiasm, he extended his arms in a manner almost
theatrical, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Al secretario</i>, <i>el
har&aacute; por usted el gusto</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Away I hurried
to the secretary, who received me with all the coolness of an
icicle.&nbsp; I related to him the words of his principal, and
then put into his hand the letter of the British minister to
myself.&nbsp; The secretary read it very deliberately, and then
said that it was evident his Excellency &ldquo;did take an
interest in the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then asked me my name,
and, taking a sheet of paper, sat down as if for the purpose of
writing the permission.&nbsp; I was in ecstasy.&nbsp; All of a
sudden, however, he stopped, lifted up his head, seemed to
consider a moment, and <a name="page1_185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>then, putting his pen behind his
ear, he said, &ldquo;Amongst the decrees of the Council of Trent
is one to the effect . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A singular person is this Oliban,&rdquo; said I to
Galiano; &ldquo;you cannot imagine what trouble he gives me; he
is continually talking about the Council of Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he was in the Trent up to the middle,&rdquo;
said Galiano, who, as I have observed already, spoke excellent
English; &ldquo;I wish he was there for talking such
nonsense.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must not
offend Oliban&mdash;he is one of us, and has done us much
service; he is, moreover, a very clever man, but he is an
Aragonese, and when one of that nation once gets an idea into his
head, it is the most difficult thing in the world to dislodge
it.&nbsp; However, we will go to him.&nbsp; He is an old friend
of mine, and I have no doubt but that we shall be able to make
him listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next day I called upon Galiano, at his marine or
admiralty office (what shall I call it?), and from thence we
proceeded to the bureau of the interior, a magnificent edifice,
which had formerly been the <i>casa</i> of the Inquisition, where
we had an interview with Oliban, whom Galiano took aside to the
window, and there held with him a long conversation, which, as
they spoke in whispers, and the room was immensely large, I did
not hear.&nbsp; At length Galiano came to me, and said,
&ldquo;There is some difficulty with respect to this business of
yours, but I have told Oliban that you are a friend of mine, and
he says that that is sufficient; remain with him now, and he will
do anything to oblige you.&nbsp; Your affair is
settled&mdash;farewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he departed, and I
remained with Oliban, who proceeded forthwith to write something,
which having concluded, <a name="page1_186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>he took out a box of cigars, and
having lighted one and offered me another, which I declined, as I
do not smoke, he placed his feet against the table, and thus
proceeded to address me, speaking in the French language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great pleasure that I see you in this
capital, and, I may say, upon this business.&nbsp; I consider it
a disgrace to Spain that there is no edition of the Gospel in
circulation, at least such a one as would be within the reach of
all classes of society, the highest or poorest; one unencumbered
with notes and commentaries, human devices, swelling it to an
unwieldy bulk.&nbsp; I have no doubt that such an edition as you
propose to print would have a most beneficial influence on the
minds of the people, who, between ourselves, know nothing of pure
religion; how should they? seeing that the Gospel has always been
sedulously kept from them, just as if civilization could exist
where the light of the Gospel beameth not.&nbsp; The moral
regeneration of Spain depends upon the free circulation of the
Scriptures; to which alone England, your own happy country, is
indebted for its high state of civilization and the unmatched
prosperity which it at present enjoys.&nbsp; All this I admit, in
fact reason compels me to do so, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; thought I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bu&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he began to talk once
more of the wearisome Council of Trent and I found that his
writing in the paper, the offer of the cigar, and the long and
prosy harangue were&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;mere
&phi;&lambda;&upsilon;&alpha;&rho;&#943;&alpha;. <a
name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a></p>
<p>By this time the spring was far advanced; the sides, though
not the tops, of the Guadarrama hills had long <a
name="page1_187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>since
lost their snows; the trees of the Prado had donned their full
foliage, and all the <i>campi&ntilde;a</i> in the neighbourhood
of Madrid smiled and was happy.&nbsp; The summer heats had not
commenced, and the weather was truly delicious.</p>
<p>Towards the west, at the foot of the hill on which stands
Madrid, is a canal running parallel with the Manzanares for some
leagues, from which it is separated by pleasant and fertile
meadows.&nbsp; The banks of this canal, which was begun by Carlos
Tercero <a name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a> and has never been completed, are
planted with beautiful trees, and form the most delightful walk
in the neighbourhood of the capital.&nbsp; Here I would loiter
for hours, looking at the shoals of gold and silver fish which
basked on the surface of the green sunny waters, or listening,
not to the warbling of birds&mdash;for Spain is not the land of
feathered choristers&mdash;but to the prattle of the
<i>narangero</i>, or man who sold oranges and water by a little
deserted water-tower just opposite the wooden bridge that crosses
the canal, which situation he had chosen as favourable for his
trade, and there had placed his stall.&nbsp; He was an Asturian
by birth, about fifty years of age, and about five feet
high.&nbsp; As I purchased freely of his fruit, he soon conceived
a great friendship for me, and told me his history; it contained,
however, nothing very remarkable, the leading incident being an
adventure which had befallen him amidst the mountains of Granada,
where, falling into the hands of certain gypsies, they stripped
him naked, and then dismissed him with a sound cudgelling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have wandered throughout Spain,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I have come to the conclusion that there are but two
places <a name="page1_188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>worth living in, Malaga and Madrid.&nbsp; At Malaga
everything is very cheap, and there is such an abundance of fish,
that I have frequently seen them piled in heaps on the seashore;
and as for Madrid, money is always stirring at the Corte, and I
never go supperless to bed.&nbsp; My only care is to sell my
oranges, and my only hope that when I die I shall be buried
yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pointed across the Manzanares, where,
on the declivity of a gentle hill, at about a league&rsquo;s
distance, shone brightly in the sunshine the white walls of the
<i>Campo Santo</i>, or common burying-ground of Madrid.</p>
<p>He was a fellow of infinite drollery, and, though he could
scarcely read or write, by no means ignorant of the ways of the
world: his knowledge of individuals was curious and extensive,
few people passing his stall with whose names, character, and
history he was not acquainted.&nbsp; &ldquo;These two
gentry,&rdquo; said he, pointing to a magnificently dressed
cavalier and lady, who had dismounted from a carriage, and
arm-in-arm were coming across the wooden bridge, followed by two
attendants; &ldquo;those gentry are the <i>Infante</i> Francisco
Paulo, and his wife the <i>Neapolitana</i>, sister of our
Christina.&nbsp; He is a very good subject, but as for his
wife&mdash;<i>vaya</i>&mdash;the veriest scold in Madrid; she can
say <i>carrajo</i> with the most ill-conditioned carrier of La
Mancha, giving the true emphasis and genuine pronunciation.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t take off your hat to her, amigo&mdash;she has neither
formality nor politeness; I once saluted her, and she took no
more notice of me than if I had not been what I am, an Asturian
and a gentleman, of better blood than herself.&nbsp; Good day,
<i>Se&ntilde;or Don</i> Francisco.&nbsp; <i>Que tal</i>. <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a>&nbsp; Very fine weather
this&mdash;<i>vaya su merced con Dios</i>.&nbsp; Those three
fellows, who just stopped to drink water, <a
name="page1_189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>are great
thieves, true sons of the prison.&nbsp; I am always civil to
them, for it would not do to be on ill terms; they pay me or not,
just as they think proper.&nbsp; I have been in some trouble on
their account: about a year ago they robbed a man a little
farther on beyond the second bridge.&nbsp; By the way, I counsel
you, brother, not to go there, as I believe you often do; it is a
dangerous place.&nbsp; They robbed a gentleman and ill-treated
him, but his brother, who was an <i>escribano</i>, was soon upon
their trail, and had them arrested; but he wanted some one to
identify them, and it chanced that they had stopped to drink
water at my stall, just as they did now.&nbsp; This the
<i>escribano</i> heard of, and forthwith had me away to prison to
confront me with them.&nbsp; I knew them well enough, but I had
learnt in my travels when to close my eyes and when to open them;
so I told the <i>escribano</i> that I could not say that I had
ever seen them before.&nbsp; He was in a great rage, and
threatened to imprison me; I told him he might, and that I cared
not.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>, I was not going to expose myself to the
resentment of those three and to that of their friends; I live
too near the Hay Market for that.&nbsp; Good day, my young
masters.&nbsp; Murcian oranges, as you see; the genuine
dragon&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; Water sweet and cold.&nbsp; Those two
boys are the children of Gabiria, comptroller of the
queen&rsquo;s household, and the richest man in Madrid; they are
nice boys, and buy much fruit.&nbsp; It is said their father
loves them more than all his possessions.&nbsp; The old woman who
is lying beneath yon tree is the <i>Tia</i> Lucilla; she has
committed murders, and as she owes me money, I hope one day to
see her executed.&nbsp; This man was of the Walloon
guard&mdash;<i>Se&ntilde;or Don</i> Benito Mol, how do you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>This last-named personage instantly engrossed my
attention.&nbsp; He was a bulky old man, somewhat above the
middle height, with white hair and ruddy features; his eyes were
large and blue, and, whenever he fixed them on any one&rsquo;s
countenance, were full of an expression of great eagerness, as if
he were expecting the communication of some important
tidings.&nbsp; He was dressed commonly enough in a jacket and
trousers of coarse cloth of a russet colour; on his head was an
immense <i>sombrero</i>, the brim of which had been much cut and
mutilated, so as in some places to resemble the jags or denticles
of a saw.&nbsp; He returned the salutation of the orange-man, and
bowing to me, forthwith produced two scented wash-balls, which he
offered for sale, in a rough dissonant jargon, intended for
Spanish, but which seemed more like the Valencian or Catalan.</p>
<p>Upon my asking him who he was, the following conversation
ensued between us:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Swiss of Lucerne, Benedict Mol <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a> by name, once a soldier in the Walloon
guard, and now a soap-boiler, at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak the language of Spain very
imperfectly,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;how long have you been in the
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five years,&rdquo; replied Benedict; &ldquo;but
when the guard was broken up, I went to Minorca, where I lost the
Spanish language without acquiring the Catalan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a soldier of the king of Spain,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;how did you like the service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so well, but that I should have been glad to <a
name="page1_191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>leave it
forty years ago; the pay was bad, and the treatment worse.&nbsp;
I will now speak Swiss to you, for, if I am not much mistaken,
you are a German man, and understand the speech of Lucerne.&nbsp;
I should soon have deserted from the service of Spain, as I did
from that of the Pope, whose soldier I was in my early youth,
before I came here; but I had married a woman of Minorca, by whom
I had two children; it was this that detained me in those parts
so long; before, however, I left Minorca my wife died, and as for
my children, one went east, the other west, and I know not what
became of them.&nbsp; I intend shortly to return to Lucerne, and
live there like a duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you, then, realized a large capital in
Spain?&rdquo; said I, glancing at his hat and the rest of his
apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a <i>cuart</i>, <a name="citation191"></a><a
href="#footnote191" class="citation">[191]</a> not a
<i>cuart</i>; these two wash-balls are all that I
possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are the son of good parents, and have lands
and money in your own country wherewith to support
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a <i>heller</i>, not a <i>heller</i>; my father was
hangman of Lucerne, and when he died, his body was seized to pay
his debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, doubtless,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you intend to
ply your trade of soap-boiling at Lucerne.&nbsp; You are right,
my friend; I know of no occupation more honourable or
useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no thoughts of plying my trade at
Lucerne,&rdquo; replied Benedict; &ldquo;and now, as I see you
are a German man, <i>lieber Herr</i>, and as I like your
countenance and your manner of speaking, I will tell you in
confidence that I know very little of my trade, and have already
<a name="page1_192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>been
turned out of several fabriques as an evil workman; the two
wash-balls that I carry in my pocket are not of my own
making.&nbsp; <i>In kurzem</i>, <a name="citation192"></a><a
href="#footnote192" class="citation">[192]</a> I know little more
of soap-boiling than I do of tailoring, horse-farriery, or
shoe-making, all of which I have practised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know not how you can hope to live like a
<i>Herzog</i> in your native canton, unless you expect that the
men of Lucerne, in consideration of your services to the Pope and
to the King of Spain, will maintain you in splendour at the
public expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Lieber Herr</i>,&rdquo; said Benedict, &ldquo;the
men of Lucerne are by no means fond of maintaining the soldiers
of the Pope and the King of Spain at their own expense.&nbsp;
Many of the guard who have returned thither beg their bread in
the streets; but when I go, it shall be in a coach drawn by six
mules, with a treasure, a mighty <i>Schatz</i> which lies in the
church of Saint James of Compostella, in Galicia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you do not intend to rob the church,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;if you do, however, I believe you will be
disappointed.&nbsp; Mendizabal and the liberals have been
beforehand with you.&nbsp; I am informed that at present no other
treasure is to be found in the cathedrals of Spain than a few
paltry ornaments and plated utensils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good German <i>Herr</i>,&rdquo; said Benedict,
&ldquo;it is no church <i>Schatz</i>, and no person living, save
myself, knows of its existence: nearly thirty years ago, amongst
the sick soldiers who were brought to Madrid, was one of my
comrades of the Walloon Guard, who had accompanied the French to
Portugal; he was very sick and shortly died.&nbsp; Before,
however, he breathed his last, he sent for me, and upon his
death-bed told me that himself and two other soldiers, both of
whom had since <a name="page1_193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>been killed, had buried in a certain church at
Compostella a great booty which they had made in Portugal; it
consisted of gold <i>moidores</i> and of a packet of huge
diamonds from the Brazils; the whole was contained in a large
copper kettle.&nbsp; I listened with greedy ears, and from that
moment, I may say, I have known no rest, neither by day nor
night, thinking of the <i>Schatz</i>.&nbsp; It is very easy to
find, for the dying man was so exact in his description of the
place where it lies, that were I once at Compostella, I should
have no difficulty in putting my hand upon it; several times I
have been on the point of setting out on the journey, but
something has always happened to stop me.&nbsp; When my wife
died, I left Minorca with a determination to go to Saint James;
<a name="citation193a"></a><a href="#footnote193a"
class="citation">[193a]</a> but on reaching Madrid, I fell into
the hands of a Basque woman, who persuaded me to live with her,
which I have done for several years.&nbsp; She is a great
<i>Hax</i>, <a name="citation193b"></a><a href="#footnote193b"
class="citation">[193b]</a> and says that if I desert her she
will breathe a spell which shall cling to me for ever.&nbsp;
<i>Dem Gottsey Dank</i>, <a name="citation193c"></a><a
href="#footnote193c" class="citation">[193c]</a> she is now in
the hospital, and daily expected to die.&nbsp; This is my
history, <i>lieber Herr</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been the more careful in relating the above
conversation, as I shall have frequent occasion to mention the
Swiss in the course of these journals; his subsequent adventures
were highly extraordinary, and the closing one caused a great
sensation in Spain.</p>
<h2><a name="page1_194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">State of Spain&mdash;Isturitz&mdash;Revolution
of the Granja&mdash;The Disturbance&mdash;Signs of
Mischief&mdash;Newspaper Reporters&mdash;Quesada&rsquo;s
Onslaught&mdash;The closing Scene&mdash;Flight of the
Moderados&mdash;The Coffee Bowl.</p>
<p>In the mean time the affairs of the <i>moderados</i> did not
proceed in a very satisfactory manner; they were unpopular at
Madrid, and still more so in the other large towns of Spain, in
most of which <i>juntas</i> had been formed, which, taking the
local administration into their own hands, declared themselves
independent of the queen and her ministers, and refused to pay
taxes; so that the government was within a short time reduced to
great straits for money.&nbsp; The army was unpaid, and the war
languished&mdash;I mean on the part of the <i>Cristinos</i>, for
the Carlists were pushing it on with considerable vigour; parties
of their <i>guerillas</i> <a name="citation194"></a><a
href="#footnote194" class="citation">[194]</a> scouring the
country in all directions, whilst a large division, under the
celebrated Gomez, was making the entire circuit of Spain.&nbsp;
To crown the whole, an insurrection was daily expected at Madrid,
to prevent which the nationals were disarmed, which measure
tended greatly to increase their hatred against the
<i>moderado</i> government, <a name="page1_195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>and especially against Quesada, with
whom it was supposed to have originated.</p>
<p>With respect to my own matters, I lost no opportunity of
pushing forward my application; the Aragonese secretary, however,
still harped upon the Council of Trent, and succeeded in baffling
all my efforts.&nbsp; He appeared to have inoculated his
principal with his own ideas upon this subject, for the duke,
when he beheld me at his levees, took no farther notice of me
than by a contemptuous glance; and once, when I stepped up for
the purpose of addressing him, disappeared through a side-door,
and I never saw him again, for I was disgusted with the treatment
which I had received, and forbore paying any more visits at the
<i>Casa de la Inquisicion</i>.&nbsp; Poor Galiano still proved
himself my unshaken friend, but candidly informed me that there
was no hope of my succeeding in the above quarter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The duke,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;says that your request
cannot be granted; and the other day, when I myself mentioned it
in the council, began to talk of the decision of Trent, and spoke
of yourself as a plaguy pestilent fellow; whereupon I answered
him with some acrimony, and there ensued a bit of a
<i>funcion</i> between us, at which Isturitz laughed
heartily.&nbsp; By-the-by,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;what need
have you of a regular permission, which it does not appear that
any one has authority to grant?&nbsp; The best thing that you can
do under the circumstances is to commit the work to the press,
with an understanding that you shall not be interfered with when
you attempt to distribute it.&nbsp; I strongly advise you to see
Isturitz himself upon the matter.&nbsp; I will prepare him for
the interview, and will answer that he receives you
civilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, a few days afterwards, I had an interview <a
name="page1_196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>with
Isturitz at the palace, and for the sake of brevity I shall
content myself with saying that I found him perfectly well
disposed to favour my views.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have lived long in
England,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the Bible is free there, and I
see no reason why it should not be free in Spain also.&nbsp; I am
not prepared to say that England is indebted for her prosperity
to the knowledge which all her children, more or less, possess of
the sacred writings; but of one thing I am sure, namely, that the
Bible has done no harm in that country, nor do I believe that it
will effect any in Spain.&nbsp; Print it, therefore, by all
means, and circulate it as extensively as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I retired, highly satisfied with my interview, having obtained,
if not a written permission to print the sacred volume, what,
under all circumstances, I considered as almost
equivalent&mdash;an understanding that my biblical pursuits would
be tolerated in Spain; and I had fervent hope that, whatever was
the fate of the present ministry, no future one, particularly a
liberal one, would venture to interfere with me, more especially
as the English ambassador was my friend, and was privy to all the
steps I had taken throughout the whole affair. <a
name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a></p>
<p>Two or three things connected with the above interview with
Isturitz struck me as being highly remarkable.&nbsp; First of
all, the extreme facility with which I obtained admission to the
presence of the prime minister of Spain.&nbsp; I had not to wait,
or indeed to send in my name, but was introduced at once by the
doorkeeper.&nbsp; Secondly, the air of loneliness which pervaded
<a name="page1_197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the
place, so unlike the bustle, noise, and activity which I observed
when I waited on Mendizabal.&nbsp; In this instance, there were
no eager candidates for an interview with the great man; indeed,
I did not behold a single individual, with the exception of
Isturitz and the official.&nbsp; But that which made the most
profound impression upon me, was the manner of the minister
himself, who, when I entered, sat upon a sofa, with his arms
folded, and his eyes directed to the ground.&nbsp; When he spoke
there was extreme depression in the tones of his voice, his dark
features wore an air of melancholy, and he exhibited all the
appearance of a person meditating to escape from the miseries of
this life by the most desperate of all acts&mdash;suicide.</p>
<p>And a few days showed that he had, indeed, cause for much
melancholy meditation: in less than a week occurred the
revolution of La Granja, <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a> as it is
called.&nbsp; La Granja, or the Grange, is a royal country seat,
situated amongst pine forests on the other side of the Guadarrama
hills, about twelve leagues distant from Madrid.&nbsp; To this
place the Queen Regent Christina had retired, in order to be
aloof from the discontent of the capital, and to enjoy rural air
and amusements in this celebrated retreat, a monument of the
taste and magnificence of the first Bourbon who ascended the
throne of Spain.&nbsp; She was not, however, permitted to remain
long in tranquillity; her own guards were disaffected, and more
inclined to the principles of the constitution of 1823 than to
those of absolute monarchy, which the <i>moderados</i> were
attempting to revive again in the government of Spain.&nbsp;
Early one morning, a party of these soldiers, headed by a certain
Sergeant Garcia, entered her apartment, and proposed that she
should <a name="page1_198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>subscribe her hand to this constitution, and swear
solemnly to abide by it.&nbsp; Christina, however, who was a
woman of considerable spirit, refused to comply with this
proposal, and ordered them to withdraw.&nbsp; A scene of violence
and tumult ensued, but the Regent still continuing firm, the
soldiers at length led her down to one of the courts of the
palace, where stood her well-known paramour, Mu&ntilde;oz, bound
and blindfolded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Swear to the constitution, you
she-rogue,&rdquo; vociferated the swarthy sergeant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the spirited daughter of the Neapolitan
Bourbons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then your <i>cortejo</i> shall die!&rdquo;
replied the sergeant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho! ho! my lads; get ready
your arms, and send four bullets through the fellow&rsquo;s
brain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mu&ntilde;oz was forthwith led to the wall,
and compelled to kneel down, the soldiers levelled their muskets,
and another moment would have consigned the unfortunate wight to
eternity, when Christina, forgetting everything but the feelings
of her woman&rsquo;s heart, suddenly started forward with a
shriek, exclaiming, &ldquo;Hold, hold!&nbsp; I sign, I
sign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after this event <a name="citation198"></a><a
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a> I entered the
Puerta del Sol at about noon.&nbsp; There is always a crowd there
about this hour, but it is generally a very quiet motionless
crowd, consisting of listless idlers calmly smoking their cigars,
or listening to or retailing the&mdash;in general&mdash;very dull
news of the capital; but on the day of which I am speaking, the
mass was no longer inert.&nbsp; There was much gesticulation and
vociferation, and several people were running about shouting,
&ldquo;<i>Viva la constitucion</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;a cry which, a
few days previously, would have been visited on the utterer with
death, the city having for some weeks past been subjected to the
rigour of martial law.&nbsp; I occasionally <a
name="page1_199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>heard the
words, &ldquo;<i>La Granja</i>!&nbsp; <i>La Granja</i>!&rdquo;
which words were sure to be succeeded by the shout of
&ldquo;<i>Viva la constitucion</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Opposite the
<i>Casa de Postas</i> <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a> were drawn up in a
line about a dozen mounted dragoons, some of whom were
continually waving their caps in the air and joining the common
cry, in which they were encouraged by their commander, a handsome
young officer, who flourished his sword, and more than once cried
out with great glee, &ldquo;Long live the constitutional
queen!&nbsp; Long live the constitution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was rapidly increasing, and several nationals made
their appearance in their uniforms, but without their arms, of
which they had been deprived, as I have already stated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What has become of the <i>moderado</i> government?&rdquo;
said I to Baltasar, whom I suddenly observed amongst the crowd,
dressed as when I had first seen him, in his old regimental great
coat and foraging cap; &ldquo;have the ministers been deposed and
others put in their place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, <i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said the little
soldier-tailor; &ldquo;not yet; the scoundrels still hold out,
relying on the brute bull Quesada and a few infantry, who still
continue true to them.&nbsp; But there is no fear, <i>Don
Jorge</i>; the queen is ours, thanks to the courage of my friend
Garcia, and if the brute bull should make his
appearance&mdash;ho! ho! <i>Don Jorge</i>, you shall see
something&mdash;I am prepared for him, ho! ho!&rdquo; and
thereupon he half opened his great coat, and showed me a small
gun which he bore beneath it in a sling, and then moving away
with a wink and a nod, disappeared amongst the crowd.</p>
<p>Presently I perceived a small body of soldiers advancing up
the Calle Mayor, or principal street which <a
name="page1_200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>runs from
the Puerta del Sol in the direction of the palace; they might be
about twenty in number, and an officer marched at their head with
a drawn sword.&nbsp; The men appeared to have been collected in a
hurry, many of them being in fatigue dress, with foraging caps on
their heads.&nbsp; On they came, slowly marching; neither their
officer nor themselves paying the slightest attention to the
cries of the crowd which thronged about them, shouting,
&ldquo;Long live the constitution!&rdquo; save and except by an
occasional surly side glance: on they marched with contracted
brows and set teeth, till they came in front of the cavalry,
where they halted and drew up in rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men mean mischief,&rdquo; said I to my friend
D---, of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, who at this moment joined
me; &ldquo;and depend upon it, that if they are ordered they will
commence firing, caring nothing whom they hit.&nbsp; But what can
those cavalry fellows behind them mean, who are evidently of the
other opinion by their shouting?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t they
charge at once this handful of foot people and overturn
them?&nbsp; Once down, the crowd would wrest from them their
muskets in a moment.&nbsp; You are a liberal, which I am not; why
do you not go to that silly young man who commands the horse and
give him a word of counsel in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D--- turned upon me his broad red good-humoured English
countenance, with a peculiarly arch look, as much as to say, . .
. (whatever you think most applicable, gentle reader), then
taking me by the arm, &ldquo;Let us get,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;out of this crowd and mount to some window, where I can
write down what is about to take place, for I agree with you that
mischief is meant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just opposite the post-office was
a large <a name="page1_201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>house, in the topmost story of which we beheld a paper
displayed, importing that apartments were to let; whereupon we
instantly ascended the common stair, and having agreed with the
mistress of the <i>&eacute;tage</i> for the use of the front room
for the day, we bolted the door, and the reporter, producing his
pocket-book and pencil, prepared to take notes of the coming
events, which were already casting their shadow before.</p>
<p>What most extraordinary men are these reporters of newspapers
in general, I mean English newspapers!&nbsp; Surely if there be
any class of individuals who are entitled to the appellation of
cosmopolites, it is these; who pursue their avocation in all
countries indifferently, and accommodate themselves at will to
the manners of all classes of society: their fluency of style as
writers is only surpassed by their facility of language in
conversation, and their attainments in classical and polite
literature only by their profound knowledge of the world,
acquired by an early introduction into its bustling scenes.&nbsp;
The activity, energy, and courage which they occasionally display
in the pursuit of information, are truly remarkable.&nbsp; I saw
them during the three days at Paris, mingled with <i>canaille</i>
and <i>gamins</i> behind the barriers, whilst the
<i>mitraille</i> was flying in all directions, and the desperate
cuirassiers were dashing their fierce horses against these
seemingly feeble bulwarks.&nbsp; There stood they, dotting down
their observations in their pocket-books as unconcernedly as if
reporting the proceedings of a reform meeting in Covent Garden or
Finsbury Square; whilst in Spain, several of them accompanied the
Carlist and <i>Cristino guerillas</i> in some of their most
desperate raids and expeditions, exposing themselves <a
name="page1_202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>to the
danger of hostile bullets, the inclemency of winter, and the
fierce heat of the summer sun.</p>
<p>We had scarcely been five minutes at the window, when we
suddenly heard the clattering of horses&rsquo; feet hastening
down the street called the Calle de Carretas.&nbsp; The house in
which we had stationed ourselves was, as I have already observed,
just opposite to the post-office, at the left of which this
street debouches from the north into the Puerta del Sol: as the
sounds became louder and louder, the cries of the crowd below
diminished, and a species of panic seemed to have fallen upon
all: once or twice, however, I could distinguish the words,
&ldquo;Quesada!&nbsp; Quesada!&rdquo;&nbsp; The foot soldiers
stood calm and motionless, but I observed that the cavalry, with
the young officer who commanded them, displayed both confusion
and fear, exchanging with each other some hurried words.&nbsp;
All of a sudden that part of the crowd which stood near the mouth
of the Calle de Carretas fell back in great disorder, leaving a
considerable space unoccupied, and the next moment Quesada, in
complete general&rsquo;s uniform, and mounted on a bright bay
thoroughbred English horse, with a drawn sword in his hand,
dashed at full gallop into the area, in much the same manner as I
have seen a Manchegan bull rush into the amphitheatre when the
gates of his pen are suddenly flung open.</p>
<p>He was closely followed by two mounted officers, and at a
short distance by as many dragoons.&nbsp; In almost less time
than is sufficient to relate it, several individuals in the crowd
were knocked down and lay sprawling upon the ground, beneath the
horses of Quesada and his two friends, for as to the dragoons,
they halted as soon as they had entered the Puerta <a
name="page1_203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>del
Sol.&nbsp; It was a fine sight to see three men, by dint of
valour and good horsemanship, strike terror into at least as many
thousands: I saw Quesada spur his horse repeatedly into the dense
masses of the crowd, and then extricate himself in the most
masterly manner.&nbsp; The rabble were completely awed, and gave
way, retiring by the Calle del Comercio and the Calle del
Alcal&aacute;.&nbsp; All at once, Quesada singled out two
nationals, who were attempting to escape, and setting spurs to
his horse, turned them in a moment, and drove them in another
direction, striking them in a contemptuous manner with the flat
of his sabre.&nbsp; He was crying out, &ldquo;Long live the
absolute queen!&rdquo; when, just beneath me, amidst a portion of
the crowd which had still maintained its ground, perhaps from not
having the means of escaping, I saw a small gun glitter for a
moment; then there was a sharp report, and a bullet had nearly
sent Quesada to his long account, passing so near to the
countenance of the general as to graze his hat.&nbsp; I had an
indistinct view for a moment of a well-known foraging cap just
about the spot from whence the gun had been discharged, then
there was a rush of the crowd, and the shooter, whoever he was,
escaped discovery amidst the confusion which arose.</p>
<p>As for Quesada, he seemed to treat the danger from which he
had escaped with the utmost contempt.&nbsp; He glared about him
fiercely for a moment, then leaving the two nationals, who
sneaked away like whipped hounds, he went up to the young officer
who commanded the cavalry, and who had been active in raising the
cry of the constitution, and to him he addressed a few words with
an air of stern menace; the youth evidently quailed before him,
and, probably in <a name="page1_204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>obedience to his orders, resigned the command of the
party, and rode away with a discomfited air; whereupon Quesada
dismounted and walked slowly backwards and forwards before the
<i>Casa de Postas</i> with a mien which seemed to bid defiance to
mankind.</p>
<p>This was the glorious day of Quesada&rsquo;s existence, his
glorious and last day.&nbsp; I call it the day of his glory, for
he certainly never before appeared under such brilliant
circumstances, and he never lived to see another sun set.&nbsp;
No action of any conqueror or hero on record is to be compared
with this closing scene of the life of Quesada, for who, by his
single desperate courage and impetuosity, ever stopped a
revolution in full course?&nbsp; Quesada did: he stopped the
revolution at Madrid for one entire day, and brought back the
uproarious and hostile mob of a huge city to perfect order and
quiet.&nbsp; His burst into the Puerta del Sol was the most
tremendous and successful piece of daring ever witnessed.&nbsp; I
admired so much the spirit of the &ldquo;brute bull&rdquo; that I
frequently, during his wild onset, shouted &ldquo;<i>Viva
Quesada</i>!&rdquo; for I wished him well.&nbsp; Not that I am of
any political party or system.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; I have lived
too long with <i>Romany Chals</i> <a name="citation204a"></a><a
href="#footnote204a" class="citation">[204a]</a> and
<i>Petulengres</i> <a name="citation204b"></a><a
href="#footnote204b" class="citation">[204b]</a> to be of any
politics save gypsy politics; and it is well known that, during
elections, the children of Roma side with both parties so long as
the event is doubtful, promising success to each; and then when
the fight is done, and the battle won, invariably range
themselves in the <a name="page1_205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>ranks of the victorious.&nbsp; But I
repeat that I wished well to Quesada, witnessing, as I did, his
stout heart and good horsemanship.&nbsp; Tranquillity was
restored to Madrid throughout the remainder of the day; the
handful of infantry bivouacked in the Puerta del Sol.&nbsp; No
more cries of &ldquo;long live the constitution&rdquo; were
heard; and the revolution in the capital seemed to have been
effectually put down.&nbsp; It is probable, indeed, that had the
chiefs of the <i>moderado</i> party but continued true to
themselves for forty-eight hours longer, their cause would have
triumphed, and the revolutionary soldiers at La Granja would have
been glad to restore the Queen Regent to liberty, and to have
come to terms, as it was well known that several regiments, who
still continued loyal, were marching upon Madrid.&nbsp; The
<i>moderados</i>, however, were <i>not</i> true to themselves;
that very night their hearts failed them, and they fled in
various directions&mdash;Isturitz and Galiano to France; and the
Duke of Rivas to Gibraltar.&nbsp; The panic of his colleagues
even infected Quesada, who, disguised as a civilian, took to
flight.&nbsp; He was not, however, so successful as the rest, but
was recognized at a village about three leagues from Madrid, and
cast into the prison by some friends of the constitution.&nbsp;
Intelligence of his capture was instantly transmitted to the
capital, and a vast mob of the nationals, some on foot, some on
horseback, and others in cabriolets, instantly set out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The nationals are coming,&rdquo; said a <i>paisano</i> to
Quesada.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am
lost,&rdquo; and forthwith prepared himself for death.</p>
<p>There is a celebrated coffee-house in the Calle del
Alcal&aacute;, at Madrid, capable of holding several hundred
individuals.&nbsp; On the evening of the day in question, I was
seated there, sipping a cup of the brown beverage, <a
name="page1_206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>when I
heard a prodigious noise and clamour in the street; it proceeded
from the nationals, who were returning from their
expedition.&nbsp; In a few minutes I saw a body of them enter the
coffee-house, marching arm in arm, two by two, stamping on the
ground with their feet in a kind of measure, and repeating in
loud chorus, as they walked round the spacious apartment, the
following grisly stanza:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Que es lo que abaja<br />
Por aquel cerro?<br />
Ta ra ra ra ra.<br />
Son los huesos de Quesada,<br />
Que los trae un perro&mdash;<br />
Ta ra ra ra ra.&rdquo; <a name="citation206"></a><a
href="#footnote206" class="citation">[206]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A huge bowl of coffee was then called for, which was placed
upon a table, around which gathered the national soldiers.&nbsp;
There was silence for a moment, which was interrupted by a voice
roaring out, &ldquo;<i>El pa&ntilde;uelo</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; A blue
kerchief was forthwith produced, which appeared to contain a
substance of some kind; it was untied, and a gory hand and three
or four dissevered fingers made their appearance, and with these
the contents of the bowl were stirred up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cups!
cups!&rdquo; cried the nationals. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho, <i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; cried Baltasarito,

<p class="gutsumm">The Steamer&mdash;Cape Finisterre&mdash;The
Storm&mdash;Arrival at Cadiz&mdash;The New
Testament&mdash;Seville&mdash;Italica&mdash;The
Amphitheatre&mdash;The Prisoners&mdash;The Encounter&mdash;Baron
Taylor&mdash;The Street and Desert.</p>
<p>At the commencement of November <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a> I again found
myself on the salt water, on my way to Spain.&nbsp; I had
returned to England shortly after the events which have been
narrated in the last chapter, for the purpose of consulting with
my friends, and for planning the opening of a biblical campaign
in Spain.&nbsp; It was now determined by us to print the New
Testament, with as little delay as possible, at Madrid; and I was
to be entrusted with the somewhat arduous task of its
distribution.&nbsp; My stay in England was very short, for time
was precious, and I was eager to return to the field of
action.</p>
<p>I embarked in the Thames, on board the <i>M---</i>
steamer.&nbsp; We had a most unpleasant passage to
Falmouth.&nbsp; The ship was crowded with passengers; most of
them were poor consumptive individuals, and other invalids
fleeing from the cold blasts of England&rsquo;s winter to the
sunny shores of Portugal and Madeira.&nbsp; In a more
uncomfortable vessel, especially steamship, <a
name="page1_209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>it has
never been my fate to make a voyage.&nbsp; The berths were small
and insupportably close, and of these wretched holes mine was
amongst the worst, the rest having been bespoken before I arrived
on board; so that, to avoid the suffocation which seemed to
threaten me, should I enter it, I lay upon the floor of one of
the cabins throughout the voyage.&nbsp; We remained at Falmouth
twenty-four hours, taking in coal and repairing the engine, which
had sustained considerable damage.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 7th, we again started, and made for the Bay of
Biscay.&nbsp; The sea was high, and the wind strong and contrary;
nevertheless, on the morning of the fourth day, we were in sight
of the rocky coast to the north of Cape Finisterre.&nbsp; I must
here observe, that this was the first voyage that the captain who
commanded the vessel had ever made on board of her, and that he
knew little or nothing of the coast towards which we were
bearing.&nbsp; He was a person picked up in a hurry, the former
captain having resigned his command on the ground that the ship
was not seaworthy, and that the engines were frequently
unserviceable.&nbsp; I was not acquainted with these
circumstances at the time, or perhaps I should have felt more
alarmed than I did, when I saw the vessel approaching nearer and
nearer the shore, till at last we were only a few hundred yards
distant.&nbsp; As it was, however, I felt very much surprised;
for having passed it twice before, both times in steam-vessels,
and having seen with what care the captains endeavoured to
maintain a wide offing, I could not conceive the reason of our
being now so near this dangerous region.&nbsp; The wind was
blowing hard towards the shore, if that can be called a shore
which consists of steep abrupt <a name="page1_210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>precipices, on which the surf was
breaking with the noise of thunder, tossing up clouds of spray
and foam to the height of a cathedral.&nbsp; We coasted slowly
along, rounding several tall forelands, some of them piled up by
the hand of nature in the most fantastic shapes.&nbsp; About
nightfall Cape Finisterre was not far ahead&mdash;a bluff, brown
granite mountain, whose frowning head may be seen far away by
those who traverse the ocean.&nbsp; The stream which poured round
its breast was terrific, and though our engines plied with all
their force, we made little or no way.</p>
<p>By about eight o&rsquo;clock at night the wind had increased
to a hurricane, the thunder rolled frightfully, and the only
light which we had to guide us on our way was the red forked
lightning, which burst at times from the bosom of the big black
clouds which lowered over our heads.&nbsp; We were exerting
ourselves to the utmost to weather the cape, which we could
descry by the lightning on our lee, its brow being frequently
brilliantly lighted up by the flashes which quivered around it,
when suddenly, with a great crash, the engine broke, and the
paddles, on which depended our lives, ceased to play.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to depict the scene of horror and confusion
which ensued; it may be imagined, but never described.&nbsp; The
captain, to give him his due, displayed the utmost coolness and
intrepidity: he and the whole crew made the greatest exertions to
repair the engine, and when they found their labour in vain,
endeavoured, by hoisting the sails, and by practising all
possible man&oelig;uvres, to preserve the ship from impending
destruction.&nbsp; But all was of no avail; we were hard on a lee
shore, to which the howling tempest was impelling us.&nbsp; About
this time I was standing <a name="page1_211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>near the helm, and I asked the
steersman if there was any hope of saving the vessel, or our
lives.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Sir, it is a bad affair; no boat
could live for a minute in this sea, and in less than an hour the
ship will have her broadside on Finisterre, where the strongest
man-of-war ever built must go to shivers instantly.&nbsp; None of
us will see the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain likewise
informed the other passengers in the cabin to the same effect,
telling them to prepare themselves; and having done so, he
ordered the door to be fastened, and none to be permitted to come
on deck.&nbsp; I however kept my station, though almost drowned
with water, immense waves continually breaking over our windward
side and flooding the ship.&nbsp; The water-casks broke from
their lashings, and one of them struck me down, and crushed the
foot of the unfortunate man at the helm, whose place was
instantly taken by the captain.&nbsp; We were now close to the
rocks, when a horrid convulsion of the elements took place.&nbsp;
The lightning enveloped us as with a mantle; the thunders were
louder than the roar of a million cannon; the dregs of the ocean
seemed to be cast up, and in the midst of all this turmoil, the
wind, without the slightest intimation, <i>veered right
about</i>, and pushed us from the horrible coast faster than it
had previously driven us towards it.</p>
<p>The oldest sailors on board acknowledged that they had never
witnessed so providential an escape.&nbsp; I said, from the
bottom of my heart, &ldquo;Our Father&mdash;hallowed be Thy
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day we were near foundering, for the sea was
exceedingly high, and our vessel, which was not intended for
sailing, laboured terribly, and leaked much.&nbsp; The pumps were
continually working.&nbsp; She <a name="page1_212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>likewise took fire, but the flames
were extinguished.&nbsp; In the evening the steam-engine was
partially repaired, and we reached Lisbon on the thirteenth,
where in a few days we completed our repairs.</p>
<p>I found my excellent friend W--- in good health.&nbsp; During
my absence he had been doing everything in his power to further
the sale of the sacred volume in Portuguese: his zeal and
devotedness were quite admirable.&nbsp; The distracted state of
the country, however, during the last six months, had sadly
impeded his efforts.&nbsp; The minds of the people had been so
engrossed with politics, that they found scarcely any time to
think of the welfare of their souls.&nbsp; The political history
of Portugal had of late afforded a striking parallel to that of
the neighbouring country.&nbsp; In both a struggle for supremacy
had arisen between the court and the democratic party; in both
the latter had triumphed, whilst two distinguished individuals
had fallen a sacrifice to the popular fury&mdash;Freire <a
name="citation212a"></a><a href="#footnote212a"
class="citation">[212a]</a> in Portugal, and Quesada in
Spain.&nbsp; The news which reached me at Lisbon from the latter
country was rather startling.&nbsp; The hordes of Gomez <a
name="citation212b"></a><a href="#footnote212b"
class="citation">[212b]</a> were ravaging Andalusia, which I was
about to visit on my way to Madrid; Cordova had been sacked and
abandoned, after a three days&rsquo; occupation by the
Carlists.&nbsp; I was told that if I persisted in my attempt to
enter Spain in the direction which I proposed, I should probably
fall into their hands at Seville.&nbsp; I had, however, no fears,
and had full confidence that the Lord would open the path before
me to Madrid.</p>
<p><a name="page1_213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>The
vessel being repaired, we again embarked, and in two days arrived
in safety at Cadiz.&nbsp; I found great confusion reigning there;
numerous bands of the factious were reported to be hovering in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; An attack was not deemed improbable, and
the place had just been declared in a state of siege.&nbsp; I
took up my abode at the French hotel, in the Calle de la Niveria,
and was allotted a species of cockloft, or garret, to sleep in,
for the house was filled with guests, being a place of much
resort, on account of the excellent <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> which is kept there.&nbsp; I dressed
myself, and walked about the town.&nbsp; I entered several
coffee-houses: the din of tongues in all was deafening.&nbsp; In
one no less than six orators were haranguing at the same time on
the state of the country, and the probability of an intervention
on the part of England and France.&nbsp; As I was listening to
one of them, he suddenly called upon me for my opinion, as I was
a foreigner, and seemingly just arrived.&nbsp; I replied that I
could not venture to guess what steps the two governments would
pursue under the present circumstances, but thought that it would
be as well if the Spaniards would exert themselves more, and call
less on Jupiter.&nbsp; As I did not wish to engage in any
political conversation, I instantly quitted the house, and sought
those parts of the town where the lower classes principally
reside.</p>
<p>I entered into discourse with several individuals, but found
them very ignorant; none could read or write, and their ideas
respecting religion were anything but satisfactory&mdash;most
professing a perfect indifference.&nbsp; I afterwards went into a
bookseller&rsquo;s shop, and made inquiries respecting the demand
for literature, which he informed me was small.&nbsp; I produced
a London <a name="page1_214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>edition of the New Testament, in Spanish, and asked the
bookseller whether he thought a book of that description would
sell in Cadiz.&nbsp; He said that both the type and paper were
exceedingly beautiful, but that it was a work not sought after
and very little known.&nbsp; I did not pursue my inquiries in
other shops, for I reflected that I was not likely to receive a
very favourable opinion from booksellers respecting a publication
in which they had no interest.&nbsp; I had, moreover, but two or
three copies of the New Testament with me, and could not have
supplied them, had they even given me an order.</p>
<p>Early on the 24th I embarked for Seville, in the small Spanish
steamer the <i>Betis</i>. <a name="citation214"></a><a
href="#footnote214" class="citation">[214]</a>&nbsp; The morning
was wet, and the aspect of nature was enveloped in a dense mist,
which prevented my observing surrounding objects.&nbsp; After
proceeding about six leagues, we reached the north-eastern
extremity of the Bay of Cadiz, and passed by San Lucar, an
ancient town near to the spot where the Guadalquivir disembogues
itself.&nbsp; The mist suddenly disappeared, and the sun of Spain
burst forth in full brilliancy, enlivening all round, and
particularly myself, who had till then been lying on the deck in
a dull melancholy stupor.&nbsp; We entered the mouth of
&ldquo;The Great River,&rdquo; for that is the English
translation of <i>Wady al Kebir</i>, as the Moors designated the
ancient Betis.&nbsp; We came to anchor for a few minutes at a
little village called Bonanza, at the extremity of the first
reach of the river, where we received several passengers, and
again proceeded.&nbsp; There is not much in the appearance of the
Guadalquivir to interest the traveller: the banks <a
name="page1_215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>are low
and destitute of trees, the adjacent country is flat, and only in
the distance is seen a range of tall blue sierras.&nbsp; The
water is turbid and muddy, and in colour closely resembling the
contents of a duck-pool; the average width of the stream is from
150 to 200 yards.&nbsp; But it is impossible to move along this
river without remembering that it has borne the Roman, the
Vandal, and the Arab, and has been the witness of deeds which
have resounded through the world, and been the themes of immortal
songs.&nbsp; I repeated Latin verses and fragments of old Spanish
ballads till we reached Seville, at about nine o&rsquo;clock of a
lovely moonlight night.</p>
<p>Seville contains ninety thousand inhabitants, and is situated
on the eastern bank of the Guadalquivir, about eighteen leagues
from its mouth; it is surrounded with high Moorish walls, in a
good state of preservation, and built of such durable materials
that it is probable they will for many centuries still bid
defiance to the encroachments of time.&nbsp; The most remarkable
edifices are the cathedral and <i>alcazar</i>, or palace of the
Moorish kings.&nbsp; The tower of the former, called La Giralda,
<a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a> belongs to the period of the Moors,
and formed part of the grand mosque of Seville: it is computed to
be one hundred ells in height, and is ascended not by stairs or
ladders, but by a vaulted pathway, in the manner of an inclined
plane.&nbsp; This path is by no means steep, so that a cavalier
might ride up to the top, a feat which Ferdinand the Seventh is
said to have accomplished.&nbsp; The view from the summit is very
extensive, and on a fine clear day the <a
name="page1_216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>mountain
ridge called the Sierra de Ronda may be discovered, though
upwards of twenty leagues distant.&nbsp; The cathedral itself is
a noble Gothic structure, <a name="citation216a"></a><a
href="#footnote216a" class="citation">[216a]</a> reputed the
finest of the kind in Spain.&nbsp; In the chapels allotted to the
various saints are some of the most magnificent paintings which
Spanish art has produced; indeed, the cathedral of Seville is at
the present time far more rich in splendid paintings than at any
former period, possessing many very recently removed from some of
the suppressed convents, particularly from the Capuchin and San
Francisco.</p>
<p>No one should visit Seville without paying particular
attention to the <i>alcazar</i>, that splendid specimen of
Moorish architecture.&nbsp; It contains many magnificent halls,
particularly that of the ambassadors, so called, which is in
every respect more magnificent than the one of the same name
within the Alhambra of Granada.&nbsp; This palace was a favourite
residence of Peter the Cruel, <a name="citation216b"></a><a
href="#footnote216b" class="citation">[216b]</a> who carefully
repaired it without altering its Moorish character and
appearance.&nbsp; It probably remains in much the same state as
at the time of his death.</p>
<p>On the right side of the river is a large suburb, called
Triana, communicating with Seville by means of a bridge of boats;
<a name="citation216c"></a><a href="#footnote216c"
class="citation">[216c]</a> for there is no permanent <a
name="page1_217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>bridge
across the Guadalquivir, owing to the violent inundations to
which it is subject.&nbsp; This suburb is inhabited by the dregs
of the populace, and abounds with <i>Gitanos</i> or
gypsies.&nbsp; About a league and a half to the north-west stands
the village of Santi Ponce: at the foot and on the side of some
elevated ground higher up are to be seen vestiges of ruined walls
and edifices, which once formed part of Italica, the birthplace
of Silius Italicus and Trajan, from which latter personage Triana
derives its name.</p>
<p>One fine morning I walked thither, and, having ascended the
hill, I directed my course northward.&nbsp; I soon reached what
had once been bagnios; and a little farther on, in a kind of
valley, between two gentle declivities, the amphitheatre.&nbsp;
This latter object is by far the most considerable relic of
ancient Italica; it is oval in its form, with two gateways
fronting the east and west.</p>
<p>On all sides are to be seen the time-worn broken granite
benches, from whence myriads of human beings once gazed down on
the area below, where the gladiator shouted, and the lion and the
leopard yelled: all around, beneath these flights of benches, are
vaulted excavations from whence the combatants, part human, part
bestial, darted forth by their several doors.&nbsp; I spent many
hours in this singular place, forcing my way through the wild
fennel and brushwood into the caverns, now the haunts of adders
and other reptiles, whose hissings I heard.&nbsp; Having sated my
curiosity, I left the ruins, and, returning by another way,
reached a place where lay the carcass of a horse half devoured;
upon it, with lustrous eyes, stood an enormous vulture, who, as I
approached, slowly soared aloft till he alighted on the eastern
gate of the amphitheatre, <a name="page1_218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>from whence he uttered a hoarse cry,
as if in anger that I had disturbed him from his feast of
carrion.</p>
<p>Gomez had not hitherto paid a visit to Seville: when I arrived
he was said to be in the neighbourhood of Ronda.&nbsp; The city
was under watch and ward: several gates had been blocked up with
masonry, trenches dug, and redoubts erected; but I am convinced
that the place would not have held out six hours against a
resolute attack.&nbsp; Gomez had proved himself to be a most
extraordinary man; and with his small army of Aragonese and
Basques had, within the last four months, made the tour of
Spain.&nbsp; He had very frequently been hemmed in by forces
three times the number of his own, in places whence escape
appeared impossible; but he had always baffled his enemies, whom
he seemed to laugh at.&nbsp; The most absurd accounts of
victories gained over him were continually issuing from the press
at Seville; amongst others, it was stated that his army had been
utterly defeated, himself killed, and that twelve hundred
prisoners were on their way to Seville.&nbsp; I saw these
prisoners: instead of twelve hundred desperadoes, <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a> they consisted of about twenty poor,
lame, ragged wretches, many of them boys from fourteen to sixteen
years of age.&nbsp; They were evidently camp-followers, who,
unable to keep up with the army, had been picked up straggling in
the plains and amongst the hills.</p>
<p>It subsequently appeared that no battle had occurred, and that
the death of Gomez was a fiction.&nbsp; The grand defect of Gomez
consisted in not knowing how to take advantage of circumstances:
after defeating Lopez, he might have marched to Madrid and <a
name="page1_219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>proclaimed Don Carlos there; and after sacking Cordova
he might have captured Seville.</p>
<p>There were several booksellers&rsquo; shops at Seville, in two
of which I found copies of the New Testament in Spanish, which
had been obtained from Gibraltar about two years before, since
which time six copies had been sold in one shop and four in the
other.&nbsp; The person who generally accompanied me in my walks
about the town and the neighbourhood, was an elderly Genoese, who
officiated as a kind of <i>valet de place</i> in the Posada del
Turco, where I had taken up my residence.&nbsp; On learning from
me that it was my intention to bring out an edition of the New
Testament at Madrid, he observed that copies of the work might be
extensively circulated in Andalusia.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
accustomed to bookselling,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and at one
time possessed a small shop of my own in this place.&nbsp; Once
having occasion to go to Gibraltar, I procured several copies of
the Scriptures: some, it is true, were seized by the officers of
the customs; but the rest I sold at a high price, and with
considerable profit to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had returned from a walk in the country, on a glorious
sunshiny morning of the Andalusian winter, and was directing my
steps towards my lodging: as I was passing by the portal of a
large gloomy house near the gate of Xeres, two individuals,
dressed in <i>zamarras</i>, emerged from the archway, and were
about to cross my path, when one, looking in my face, suddenly
started back, exclaiming in the purest and most melodious
French:&mdash;&ldquo;What do I see?&nbsp; If my eyes do not
deceive me&mdash;it is himself.&nbsp; Yes, the very same as I saw
him first at Bayonne; then long subsequently beneath the brick
wall at Novogorod; then beside the <a name="page1_220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Bosphorus; and last
at&mdash;at&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, my respectable and cherished friend,
where was it that I had last the felicity of seeing your
well-remembered and most remarkable physiognomy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;It was in the south of Ireland, if I
mistake not.&nbsp; Was it not there that I introduced you to the
sorcerer who tamed the savage horses by a single whisper into
their ear?&nbsp; But tell me what brings you to Spain and
Andalusia, the last place where I should have expected to find
you?</p>
<p><i>Baron Taylor</i>.&mdash;And wherefore, my most respectable
B---?&nbsp; Is not Spain the land of the arts; and is not
Andalusia of all Spain that portion which has produced the
noblest monuments of artistic excellence and inspiration?&nbsp;
Surely you know enough of me to be aware that the arts are my
passion; that I am incapable of imagining a more exalted
enjoyment than to gaze in adoration on a noble picture.&nbsp; Oh,
come with me! for you, too, have a soul capable of appreciating
what is lovely and exalted; a soul delicate and sensitive.&nbsp;
Come with me, and I will show you a Murillo, such as . . .&nbsp;
But first allow me to introduce you to your compatriot.&nbsp; My
dear Monsieur W---, turning to his companion (an English
gentleman, from whom and from his family I subsequently
experienced unbounded kindness and hospitality on various
occasions, and at different periods at Seville), allow me to
introduce to you my most cherished and respectable friend, one
who is better acquainted with gypsy ways than the <i>Chef des
Boh&eacute;miens &agrave; Triana</i>, <a
name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a> one who is an expert whisperer and
horse-sorcerer; and who, to his honour I say it, can wield hammer
and tongs, and handle a horseshoe with the best of the smiths
amongst the Alpujarras of Granada.</p>
<p><a name="page1_221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>In
the course of my travels I have formed various friendships and
acquaintances, but no one has more interested me than Baron
Taylor, <a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a> and there is no one for whom I
entertain a greater esteem and regard.&nbsp; To personal and
mental accomplishments of the highest order he unites a kindness
of heart rarely to be met with, and which is continually inducing
him to seek for opportunities of doing good to his
fellow-creatures, and of contributing to their happiness; perhaps
no person in existence has seen more of the world and life in its
various phases than himself.&nbsp; His manners are naturally to
the highest degree courtly, yet he nevertheless possesses a
disposition so pliable that he finds no difficulty in
accommodating himself to all kinds of company, in consequence of
which he is a universal favourite.&nbsp; There is a mystery about
him, which, wherever he goes, serves not a little to increase the
sensation naturally created by his appearance and manner.&nbsp;
Who he is, no one pretends to assert with downright positiveness:
it is whispered, however, that he is a scion of royalty; and who
can gaze for a <a name="page1_222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>moment upon that most graceful figure, that most
intelligent but singularly moulded countenance, and those large
and expressive eyes, without feeling as equally convinced that he
is of no common lineage, as that he is no common man?&nbsp;
Though possessed of talents and eloquence which would speedily
have enabled him to attain to an illustrious position in the
state, he has hitherto, and perhaps wisely, contented himself
with comparative obscurity, chiefly devoting himself to the study
of the arts and of literature, of both of which he is a most
bounteous patron.</p>
<p>He has, notwithstanding, been employed by the illustrious
house to which he is said to be related in more than one delicate
and important mission, both in the East and the West, in which
his efforts have uniformly been crowned with complete
success.&nbsp; He was now collecting masterpieces of the Spanish
school of painting, which were destined to adorn the saloons of
the Tuileries.</p>
<p>He has visited most portions of the earth; and it is
remarkable enough that we are continually encountering each other
in strange places and under singular circumstances.&nbsp;
Whenever he descries me, whether in the street or the desert, the
brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin <i>haimas</i>, at Novogorod or
Stambul, he flings up his arms and exclaims, &ldquo;<i>O
ciel</i>!&nbsp; I have again the felicity of seeing my cherished
and most respectable B---.&rdquo;</p>

Opinions.</p>
<p>After a sojourn of about fourteen days at Seville, I departed
for Cordova.&nbsp; The diligence had for some time past ceased
running, owing to the disturbed state of the province.&nbsp; I
had therefore no resource but to proceed thither on
horseback.&nbsp; I hired a couple of horses, and engaged the old
Genoese, of whom I have already had occasion to speak, to attend
me as far as Cordova, and to bring them back.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding we were now in the depths of winter, the weather
was beautiful, the days sunny and brilliant, though the nights
were rather keen.&nbsp; We passed by the little town of
Alcal&aacute;, <a name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a> celebrated for the ruins of an <a
name="page1_224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>immense
Moorish castle, which stand on a rocky hill, overhanging a
picturesque river.&nbsp; The first night we slept at Carmona,
another Moorish town, distant about seven leagues from
Seville.&nbsp; Early in the morning we again mounted and
departed.&nbsp; Perhaps in the whole of Spain there is scarcely a
finer Moorish monument of antiquity than the eastern side of this
town of Carmona, which occupies the brow of a lofty hill, and
frowns over an extensive <i>vega</i> or plain, which extends for
leagues unplanted and uncultivated, producing nothing but
brushwood and <i>carrasco</i>.&nbsp; Here rise tall and dusky
walls, with square towers at short distances, of so massive a
structure that they would seem to bid defiance alike to the tooth
of time and the hand of man.&nbsp; This town, in the time of the
Moors, was considered the key to Seville, and did not submit to
the Christian arms till after a long and desperate siege: the
capture of Seville followed speedily after.&nbsp; The <i>vega</i>
upon which we now entered forms a part of the grand
<i>despoblado</i> or desert of Andalusia, once a smiling garden,
but which became what it now is on the expulsion of the Moors
from Spain, when it was drained almost entirely of its
population.&nbsp; The towns and villages from hence to the Sierra
Morena, which divides Andalusia from La Mancha, are few and far
between, and even of these several date from the middle of the
last century, when an attempt was made by a Spanish minister to
people this wilderness with the children of a foreign land.</p>
<p><a name="page1_225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>At
about midday we arrived at a place called Moncloa, which
consisted of a <i>venta</i>, and a desolate-looking edifice which
had something of the appearance of a <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>; a
solitary palm tree raised its head over the outer wall.&nbsp; We
entered the <i>venta</i>, tied our horses to the manger, and
having ordered barley for them, we sat down before a large fire,
which burned in the middle of the <i>venta</i>.&nbsp; The host
and hostess also came and sat down beside us.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are evil people,&rdquo; said the old Genoese to me in Italian,
&ldquo;and this is an evil house; it is a harbouring place for
thieves, and murders have been committed here, if all tales be
true.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at these two people attentively; they
were both young, the man apparently about twenty-five years of
age.&nbsp; He was a short thick-made churl, evidently of
prodigious strength; his features were rather handsome, but with
a gloomy expression, and his eyes were full of sullen fire.&nbsp;
His wife somewhat resembled him, but had a countenance more open
and better tempered; but what struck me as most singular in
connexion with these people, was the colour of their hair and
complexion.&nbsp; The latter was fair and ruddy, and the former
of a bright auburn, both in striking contrast to the black hair
and swarthy visages which in general distinguish the natives of
this province.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you an Andalusian?&rdquo; said I
to the hostess.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should almost conclude you to be a
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hostess</i>.&mdash;And your worship would not be very
wrong.&nbsp; It is true that I am a Spaniard, being born in
Spain; but it is equally true that I am of German blood, for my
grandparents came from Germany even like those of this gentleman,
my lord and husband.</p>
<p><a name="page1_226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what chance brought your
grandparents into this country?</p>
<p><i>Hostess</i>.&mdash;Did your worship never hear of the
German colonies?&nbsp; There are many of them in these
parts.&nbsp; In old times the land was nearly deserted, and it
was very dangerous for travellers to journey along the waste,
owing to the robbers.&nbsp; So a long time ago, nearly a hundred
years, as I am told, some potent lord sent messengers to Germany,
to tell the people there what a goodly land there was in these
parts uncultivated for want of hands, and to promise every
labourer who would consent to come and till it, a house and a
yoke of oxen, with food and provision for one year.&nbsp; And in
consequence of this invitation a great many poor families left
the German land and came hither, and settled down in certain
towns and villages which had been prepared for them, which places
were called German colonies, and this name they still retain.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And how many of these colonies may there
be?</p>
<p><i>Hostess</i>.&mdash;There are several, both on this side of
Cordova and the other.&nbsp; The nearest is Luisiana, about two
leagues from hence, from which place both my husband and myself
come; the next is Carlota, <a name="citation226"></a><a
href="#footnote226" class="citation">[226]</a> <a
name="page1_227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>which is
some ten leagues distant, and these are the only colonies of our
people which I have seen; but there are others farther on, and
some, as I have heard say, in the very heart of the Sierra
Morena.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And do the colonists still retain the
language of their forefathers?</p>
<p><i>Hostess</i>.&mdash;We speak Spanish, or rather Andalusian,
and no other language.&nbsp; A few, indeed, amongst the very old
people, retain a few words of German, which they acquired from
their fathers, who were born in the other country; but the last
person amongst the colonists who could understand a conversation
in German was the aunt of my mother, who came over when a
girl.&nbsp; When I was a child I remember her conversing with a
foreign traveller, a countryman of hers, in a language which I
was told was German, and they understood each other, though the
old woman confessed that she had lost many words: she has now
been dead several years.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of what religion are the colonists?</p>
<p><i>Hostess</i>.&mdash;They are Christians, like the Spaniards,
and so were their fathers before them.&nbsp; Indeed, I have heard
that they came from a part of Germany where the Christian
religion is as much practised as in Spain itself.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;The Germans are the most honest people in
the world: being their legitimate descendants, you have of course
no thieves amongst you.</p>
<p>The hostess glanced at me for a moment, then looked at her
husband and smiled: the latter, who had hitherto been smoking
without uttering a word, though with a peculiarly surly and
dissatisfied countenance, now flung the remainder of his cigar
amongst the embers, then springing up, he muttered, <a
name="page1_228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;<i>Disparate</i>!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>Conversacion</i>!&rdquo; and went abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touched them in the sore place,
<i>Signore</i>,&rdquo; said the Genoese, after we had left
Moncloa some way behind us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were they honest people
they would not keep that <i>venta</i>; and as for the colonists,
I know not what kind of people they might be when they first came
over, but at present their ways are not a bit better than those
of the Andalusians, but rather worse, if there is any difference
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time before sunset of the third day after our
departure from Seville, we found ourselves at the Cuesta del
Espinal, or hill of the thorn tree, at about two leagues from
Cordova;&mdash;we could just descry the walls of the city, upon
which the last beams of the descending luminary were
resting.&nbsp; As the neighbourhood in which we were was,
according to the account of my guide, generally infested with
robbers, we used our best endeavours to reach the town before the
night should have entirely closed in.&nbsp; We did not succeed,
however, and before we had proceeded half the distance, pitchy
darkness overtook us.&nbsp; Throughout the journey we had been
considerably delayed by the badness of our horses, especially
that of my attendant, which appeared to pay no regard to whip or
spur: his rider also was no horseman, it being thirty years, as
he at length confessed to me, since he last mounted in a
saddle.&nbsp; Horses soon become aware of the powers of their
riders, and the brute in question was disposed to take great
advantage of the fears and weakness of the old man.&nbsp; There
is a remedy, however, for most things in this world.&nbsp; I
became so wearied at last at the snail&rsquo;s pace at which we
were proceeding, that I fastened the bridle of the sluggish <a
name="page1_229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>horse to
the crupper of mine; then sparing neither spur nor cudgel, I soon
forced my own horse into a kind of trot, which compelled the
other to make some use of his legs.&nbsp; He twice attempted to
fling himself down, to the great terror of his aged rider, who
frequently entreated me to stop and permit him to dismount.&nbsp;
I, however, took no notice of what he said, but continued
spurring and cudgelling with unabated activity, and with such
success, that in less than half an hour we saw lights close
before us, and presently came to a river and a bridge, which
crossing, we found ourselves at the gate of Cordova, without
having broken either our horses&rsquo; knees or our own
necks.</p>
<p>We passed through the entire length of the town ere we reached
the <i>posada</i>: the streets were dark and almost entirely
deserted.&nbsp; The <i>posada</i> was a large building, the
windows of which were well fenced with <i>rejas</i>, or iron
grating: no light gleamed from them, and the silence of death not
only seemed to pervade the house, but the street in which it was
situated.&nbsp; We knocked for a long time at the gate without
receiving any answer; we then raised our voices and
shouted.&nbsp; At last some one from within inquired what we
wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open the door and you will see,&rdquo; we
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; answered
the individual from within, &ldquo;until I know who you
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are travellers,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;from Seville.&rdquo;&lsquo; &ldquo;Travellers, are
you?&rdquo; said the voice; &ldquo;why did you not tell me so
before?&nbsp; I am not porter at this house to keep out
travellers.&nbsp; Jesus Maria knows we have not so many of them
that we need repulse any.&nbsp; Enter, cavalier, and welcome, you
and your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the gate and admitted us into a spacious courtyard,
and then forthwith again secured the gate <a
name="page1_230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>with
various bolts and bars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you afraid that the
Carlists should pay you a visit,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;that
you take so much precaution?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not the
Carlists we are afraid of,&rdquo; replied the porter; &ldquo;they
have been here already, and did us no damage whatever.&nbsp; It
is certain scoundrels of this town that we are afraid of, who
have a spite against the master of the house, and would murder
both him and his family, could they but find an
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to inquire the cause of this enmity, when a thick
bulky man, bearing a light in his hand, came running down a stone
staircase, which led into the interior of the building.&nbsp; Two
or three females, also bearing lights, followed him.&nbsp; He
stopped on the lowest stair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom have we
here?&rdquo; he exclaimed; then advancing the lamp which he bore,
the light fell full upon my face.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Ola</i>!&rdquo;
he exclaimed; &ldquo;is it you?&nbsp; Only think,&rdquo; said he,
turning to the female who stood next him, a dark-featured person,
stout as himself, and about his own age, which might border upon
fifty; &ldquo;only think, my dear, that at the very moment we
were wishing for a guest, an Englishman should be standing before
our doors, for I should know an Englishman at a mile&rsquo;s
distance, even in the dark.&nbsp; Juanito,&rdquo; cried he to the
porter, &ldquo;open not the gate any more to-night, whoever may
ask for admission.&nbsp; Should the nationals come to make any
disturbance, tell them that the son of Belington <a
name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230"
class="citation">[230]</a> is in the house ready to attack them
sword in hand unless they retire; and should other travellers
arrive, which is not likely, inasmuch as we have seen none for a
month past, say that we have no room, all our apartments being
occupied by an English gentleman and his company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>I
soon found that my friend the <i>posadero</i> was a most
egregious Carlist.&nbsp; Before I had finished
supper&mdash;during which, both himself and all his family were
present, surrounding the little table at which I sat, and
observing my every motion, particularly the manner in which I
handled my knife and fork and conveyed the food to my
mouth&mdash;he commenced talking politics.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am of
no particular opinion, <i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said he, for he
had inquired my name in order that he might address me in a
suitable manner; &ldquo;I am of no particular opinion, and I hold
neither for King Carlos nor for the <i>chica</i> Isabel:
nevertheless, I lead the life of a dog in this accursed
<i>Cristino</i> town, which I would have left long ago, had it
not been the place of my birth, and did I but know whither to
betake myself.&nbsp; Ever since the troubles have commenced, I
have been afraid to stir into the street, for no sooner do the
<i>canaille</i> of the town see me turning round a corner, than
they forthwith exclaim, &lsquo;Halloo, the Carlist!&rsquo; and
then there is a run and a rush, and stones and cudgels are in
great requisition; so that unless I can escape home, which is no
easy matter, seeing that I weigh eighteen stone, my life is
poured out in the street, which is neither decent nor convenient,
as I think you will acknowledge, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; You see
that young man,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to a tall swarthy
youth who stood behind my chair, officiating as waiter; &ldquo;he
is my fourth son, is married, and does not live in the house, but
about a hundred yards down the street.&nbsp; He was summoned in a
hurry to wait upon your worship, as is his duty: know, however,
that he has come at the peril of his life.&nbsp; Before he leaves
this house, he must peep out into the street to see if the coast
is clear, and then he must run like a <a
name="page1_232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>partridge
to his own door.&nbsp; Carlists! why should they call my family
and myself Carlists?&nbsp; It is true that my eldest son was a
friar, and when the convents were suppressed, betook himself to
the royal ranks, in which he has been fighting upwards of three
years; could I help that?&nbsp; Nor was it my fault, I trow, that
my second son enlisted with Gomez and the royalists when they
entered Cordova.&nbsp; God prosper him, I say; but I did not bid
him go!&nbsp; So far from being a Carlist, it was I who persuaded
this very lad who is present to remain here, though he would fain
have gone with his brother, for he is a brave lad and a true
Christian.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay at home,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for
what can I do without you?&nbsp; Who is to wait upon the guests
when it pleases God to send them?&nbsp; Stay at home, at least
till your brother, my third son, comes back; for, to my shame be
it spoken, Don Jorge, I have a son a soldier and a sergeant in
the <i>Cristino</i> armies, sorely against his own inclination,
poor fellow, for he likes not the military life, and I have been
soliciting his discharge for years; indeed, I have counselled him
to maim himself, in order that he might procure his liberty
forthwith.&nbsp; So I said to this lad, &lsquo;Stay at home, my
child, till your brother comes to take your place and prevent our
bread being eaten by strangers, who would perhaps sell me and
betray me;&rsquo; so my son staid at home, as you see, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, at my request, and yet they call me a
Carlist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gomez and his bands have lately been in Cordova,&rdquo;
<a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a> said I; &ldquo;of course you were
present at all that occurred: how did they comport
themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravely well,&rdquo; replied the innkeeper,
&ldquo;bravely well, and I wish they were here still.&nbsp; I
hold with neither side, as I told you before, <i>Don Jorge</i>,
but I confess <a name="page1_233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>I never felt greater pleasure in my life than when they
entered the gate.&nbsp; And then to see the dogs of nationals
flying through the streets to save their lives&mdash;that was a
sight, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; Those who met me then at the
corner forgot to shout, &lsquo;<i>Hola</i>!
<i>Carlista</i>!&rsquo; and I heard not a word about
cudgelling.&nbsp; Some jumped from the wall and ran no one knows
where, whilst the rest retired to the house of the Inquisition,
which they had fortified, and there they shut themselves
up.&nbsp; Now you must know, <i>Don Jorge</i>, that all the
Carlist chiefs lodged at my house&mdash;Gomez, Cabrera, and the
Sawyer; and it chanced that I was talking to my Lord Gomez in
this very room in which we are now, when in came Cabrera in a
mighty fury&mdash;he is a small man, <i>Don Jorge</i>, but he is
as active as a wild cat and as fierce.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
<i>canaille</i>,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;in the <i>Casa</i> of the
Inquisition refuse to surrender; give but the order, general, and
I will scale the walls with my men, and put them all to the
sword.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Gomez said, &lsquo;No, we must not spill
blood if we can avoid it.&nbsp; Order a few muskets to be fired
at them; that will be sufficient!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so it proved,
<i>Don Jorge</i>, for after a few discharges their hearts failed
them, and they surrendered at discretion: whereupon their arms
were taken from them, and they were permitted to return to their
own houses.&nbsp; But as soon as ever the Carlists departed,
these fellows became as bold as ever, and it is now once more,
&lsquo;<i>Hola</i>! <i>Carlista</i>!&rsquo; when they see me
turning the corner; and it is for fear of them that my son must
run like a partridge to his own home, now that he has done
waiting on your worship, lest they meet him in the street, and
kill him with their knives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me that you were acquainted with Gomez: what
kind of man might he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;A middle-sized man,&rdquo; replied the
innkeeper; &ldquo;grave and dark.&nbsp; But the most remarkable
personage in appearance of them all was the Sawyer: he is a kind
of giant, so tall, that when he entered the doorway he invariably
struck his head against the lintel.&nbsp; The one I liked least
of all was one Palillos, who is a gloomy savage ruffian, whom I
knew when he was a postilion.&nbsp; Many is the time that he has
been at my house of old; he is now captain of the Manchegan
thieves, for, though he calls himself a royalist, he is neither
more nor less than a thief.&nbsp; It is a disgrace to the cause
that such as he should be permitted to mix with honourable and
brave men.&nbsp; I hate that fellow, <i>Don Jorge</i>: it is
owing to him that I have so few customers.&nbsp; Travellers are,
at present, afraid to pass through La Mancha, lest they fall into
his hands.&nbsp; I wish he were hanged, <i>Don Jorge</i>, and
whether by <i>Cristinos</i> or Royalists, I care not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recognized me at once for an Englishman,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;do many of my countrymen visit Cordova?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Toma</i>!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;they are
my best customers; I have had Englishmen in this house of all
grades, from the son of Belington to a young <i>medico</i>, who
cured my daughter, the <i>chica</i> here, of the earache.&nbsp;
How should I not know an Englishman?&nbsp; There were two with
Gomez, serving as volunteers.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>: <i>que
gente</i>! <a name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234"
class="citation">[234]</a> what noble horses they rode, and how
they scattered their gold about!&nbsp; They brought with them a
Portuguese, who was much of a gentleman, but very poor; it was
said that he was one of Don Miguel&rsquo;s people, and that these
Englishmen <a name="page1_235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>supported him for the love they bore to royalty.&nbsp;
He was continually singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;El Rey chegou&mdash;El Rey chegou,<br />
E en Belem desembarcou!&rsquo; <a name="citation235a"></a><a
href="#footnote235a" class="citation">[235a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those were merry days, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; By-the-by, I
forgot to ask your worship of what opinion you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning whilst I was dressing, the old Genoese
entered my room: &ldquo;<i>Signore</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
am come to bid you farewell.&nbsp; I am about to return to
Seville forthwith with the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore in such a hurry?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Assuredly you had better tarry till to-morrow; both the
animals and yourself require rest.&nbsp; Repose yourselves
to-day, and I will defray the expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, <i>Signore</i>, but we will depart
forthwith, for there is no tarrying in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the house?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find no fault with the house,&rdquo; replied the
Genoese; &ldquo;it is the people who keep it of whom I
complain.&nbsp; About an hour since, I went down to get my
breakfast, and there, in the kitchen, I found the master and all
his family.&nbsp; Well, I sat down and called for chocolate,
which they brought me, but ere I could despatch it, the master
fell to talking politics.&nbsp; He commenced by telling me that
he held with neither side, but he is as rank a Carlist as Carlos
Quinto: <a name="citation235b"></a><a href="#footnote235b"
class="citation">[235b]</a> <a name="page1_236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>for no sooner did he find that I was
of the other opinion than he glared at me like a wild
beast.&nbsp; You must know, <i>Signore</i>, that in the time of
the old constitution I kept a coffee-house at Seville, which was
frequented by all the principal liberals, and was, indeed, the
cause of my ruin; for, as I admired their opinions, I gave my
customers whatever credit they required, both with regard to
coffee and liqueurs, so that by the time the constitution was put
down and despotism re-established, I had trusted them with all I
had.&nbsp; It is possible that many of them would have paid me,
for I believe they harboured no evil intention; but the
persecution came, the liberals took to flight, and, as was
natural enough, thought more of providing for their own safety
than of paying me for my coffee and liqueurs; nevertheless, I am
a friend to their system, and never hesitate to say so.&nbsp; So
the landlord, as I told your worship before, when he found that I
was of this opinion, glared at me like a wild beast.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Get out of my house,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for I will
have no spies here;&rsquo; and thereupon he spoke disrespectfully
of the young Queen Isabel and of Christina, who, notwithstanding
she is a Neapolitan, <a name="citation236a"></a><a
href="#footnote236a" class="citation">[236a]</a> I consider as my
countrywoman.&nbsp; Hearing this, your worship, I confess that I
lost my temper and returned the compliment, by saying that Carlos
was a knave, and the Princess of Beira <a
name="citation236b"></a><a href="#footnote236b"
class="citation">[236b]</a> no better than she should be.&nbsp; I
then <a name="page1_237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>prepared to swallow the chocolate, but ere I could
bring it to my lips, the woman of the house, who is a still
ranker Carlist than her husband, if that be possible, coming up
to me struck the cup into the air as high as the ceiling,
exclaiming, &lsquo;Begone, dog of a <i>negro</i>; you shall taste
nothing more in my house.&nbsp; May you be hanged even as a swine
is hanged!&rsquo;&nbsp; So your worship sees that it is
impossible for me to remain here any longer.&nbsp; I forgot to
say that the knave of a landlord told me that you had confessed
yourself to be of the same politics as himself, or he would not
have harboured you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am invariably of
the politics of the people at whose table I sit, or beneath whose
roof I sleep; at least I never say anything which can lead them
to suspect the contrary; by pursuing which system I have more
than once escaped a bloody pillow, and having the wine I drank
spiced with sublimate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little can be said with respect to the town of Cordova, which
is a mean, dark, gloomy place, full of narrow streets and alleys,
without squares or public buildings worthy of attention, save and
except its far-famed cathedral; its situation, however, is
beautiful and picturesque.&nbsp; Before it runs the Guadalquivir,
which, though in this part shallow and full of sandbanks, is
still a delightful stream; whilst behind it rise the steep sides
of the Sierra Morena, planted up to the top with olive
groves.&nbsp; The town or city is surrounded on all sides by
lofty Moorish walls, which may measure about three-quarters of a
league in circumference; unlike Seville, and most other towns in
Spain, it has no suburbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p238b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Mosque at Cordova"

"Mosque at Cordova"
src="images/p238s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I have said that Cordova has no remarkable edifices, save its
cathedral, yet this is perhaps the most extraordinary place of
worship in the world.&nbsp; It was originally, as is well known,
a mosque, built in the brightest days of Arabian dominion in
Spain.&nbsp; In shape it was quadrangular, with a low roof,
supported <a name="page1_239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>by an infinity of small and delicately rounded marble
pillars, many of which still remain, and present at first sight
the appearance of a marble grove; the greater part, however, were
removed when the Christians, after the expulsion of the Moslems,
essayed to convert the mosque into a cathedral, <a
name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239"
class="citation">[239]</a> which they effected in part by the
erection of a dome, and by clearing an open space for a
choir.&nbsp; As it at present exists, the temple appears to
belong partly to Mahomet, and partly to the Nazarene; and though
this jumbling together of massive Gothic architecture with the
light and delicate style of the Arabians produces an effect
somewhat bizarre, it still remains a magnificent and glorious
edifice, and well calculated to excite feelings of awe and
veneration within the bosom of those who enter it.</p>
<p>The Moors of Barbary seem to care but little for the exploits
of their ancestors: their minds are centred in the things of the
present day, and only so far as those things regard themselves
individually.&nbsp; Disinterested enthusiasm, that truly
distinguishing mark of a noble mind, and admiration for what is
great, good, and grand, they appear to be totally incapable of
feeling.&nbsp; It is astonishing with what indifference they
stray amongst the relics of ancient Moorish grandeur in
Spain.&nbsp; No feelings of exultation seem to be excited by the
proof of what the Moor once was, nor of regret <a
name="page1_240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>at the
consciousness of what he now is.&nbsp; More interesting to them
are their perfumes, their papouches, their dates, and their silks
of Fez and Maraks, <a name="citation240a"></a><a
href="#footnote240a" class="citation">[240a]</a> to dispose of
which they visit Andalusia; and yet the generality of these men
are far from being ignorant, and have both heard and read of what
was passing in Spain in the old time.&nbsp; I was once conversing
with a Moor at Madrid, with whom I was very intimate, about the
Alhambra of Granada, which he had visited.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you
not weep,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when you passed through the
courts, and thought of the Abencerrages?&rdquo; <a
name="citation240b"></a><a href="#footnote240b"
class="citation">[240b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I did not weep; wherefore should I weep?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And why did you visit the Alhambra?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I visited it,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;because, being at Granada on my own affairs, one of your
countrymen requested me to accompany him thither, that I might
explain some of the inscriptions.&nbsp; I should certainly not
have gone of my own accord, for the hill on which it stands is
steep.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet this man could compose verses, and
was by no means a contemptible poet.&nbsp; Once at Cordova,
whilst I was in the cathedral, three Moors entered it, and
proceeded slowly across its floor in the direction of a gate,
which stood at the opposite side.&nbsp; They took no farther
notice of what was around them than by slightly glancing once or
twice at the pillars, one of them exclaiming,
&ldquo;<i>Hu&aacute;je </i><a name="page1_241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span><i>del Mselmeen</i>, <i>hudje del
Mselmeen</i>&rdquo; (things of the Moors, things of the Moors),
and showed no other respect for the place where Abderrahman the
Magnificent prostrated himself of old, than facing about on
arriving at the farther door and making their egress backwards;
yet these men were <i>hajis</i> and <i>talibs</i>, <a
name="citation241a"></a><a href="#footnote241a"
class="citation">[241a]</a> men likewise of much gold and
silver&mdash;men who had read, who had travelled, who had seen
Mecca, and the great city of Negroland. <a
name="citation241b"></a><a href="#footnote241b"
class="citation">[241b]</a></p>
<p>I remained in Cordova much longer than I had originally
intended, owing to the accounts which I was continually hearing
of the unsafe state of the roads to Madrid.&nbsp; I soon
ransacked every nook and cranny of this ancient town, formed
various acquaintances amongst the populace, which is my general
practice on arriving at a strange place.&nbsp; I more than once
ascended the side of the Sierra Morena, in which excursions I was
accompanied by the son of my host, the tall lad of whom I have
already spoken.&nbsp; The people of the house, who had imbibed
the idea that I was of the same way of thinking as themselves,
were exceedingly courteous; it is true, that in return I was
compelled to listen to a vast deal of Carlism, in other words,
high treason against the ruling powers in Spain, to which,
however, I submitted with patience.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Don
Jorgito</i>,&rdquo; said the landlord to me one day, &ldquo;I
love the English; they are my best customers.&nbsp; It is a <a
name="page1_242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>pity that
there is not greater union between Spain and England, and that
more English do not visit us.&nbsp; Why should there not be a
marriage?&nbsp; The king will speedily be at Madrid.&nbsp; Why
should there not be <i>bodas</i> between the son of Don Carlos
and the heiress of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would certainly tend to bring a considerable number
of English to Spain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and it would not be
the first time that the son of a Carlos has married a Princess of
England.&rdquo; <a name="citation242a"></a><a
href="#footnote242a" class="citation">[242a]</a></p>
<p>The host mused for a moment, and then exclaimed,
&ldquo;<i>Carracho</i>, <i>Don Jorgito</i>, if this marriage
could be brought about, both the king and myself should have
cause to fling our caps in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house or <i>posada</i> in which I had taken up my abode
was exceedingly spacious, containing an infinity of apartments,
both large and small, the greater part of which were, however,
unfurnished.&nbsp; The chamber in which I was lodged stood at the
end of an immensely long corridor, of the kind so admirably
described in the wondrous tale of Udolfo. <a
name="citation242b"></a><a href="#footnote242b"
class="citation">[242b]</a>&nbsp; For a day or two after my
arrival I believed myself to be the only lodger in the
house.&nbsp; One morning, however, I beheld a strange-looking old
man seated in the corridor, by one of the windows, reading
intently in a small thick volume.&nbsp; He was clad in garments
of coarse blue cloth, and wore a loose spencer over a waistcoat
adorned with various rows of small buttons of mother of pearl; he
had spectacles upon his nose.&nbsp; I could perceive,
notwithstanding he was seated, that his stature bordered upon the
gigantic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that <a name="page1_243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>person?&rdquo; said I to the
landlord, whom I presently met; &ldquo;is he also a guest of
yours?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not exactly, <i>Don Jorge de mi
alma</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation243a"></a><a
href="#footnote243a" class="citation">[243a]</a> replied
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can scarcely call him a guest, inasmuch as I
gain nothing by him, though he is staying at my house.&nbsp; You
must know, <i>Don Jorge</i>, that he is one of two priests who
officiate at a large village <a name="citation243b"></a><a
href="#footnote243b" class="citation">[243b]</a> at some slight
distance from this place.&nbsp; So it came to pass, that when the
soldiers of Gomez entered the village, his reverence went to meet
them, dressed in full canonicals, with a book in his hand, and
he, at their bidding, proclaimed Carlos Quinto <a
name="citation243c"></a><a href="#footnote243c"
class="citation">[243c]</a> in the market-place.&nbsp; The other
priest, however, was a desperate liberal, a downright
<i>negro</i>, and upon him the royalists laid their hands, and
were proceeding to hang him.&nbsp; His reverence, however,
interfered, and obtained mercy for his colleague, on condition
that he should cry <i>Viva Carlos Quinto</i>! which the latter
did in order to save his life.&nbsp; Well, no sooner had the
royalists departed from these parts than the black priest mounts
his mule, comes to Cordova, and informs against his reverence,
notwithstanding that he had saved his life.&nbsp; So his
reverence was seized and brought hither to Cordova, and would
assuredly have been thrown into the common prison as a Carlist,
had I not stepped forward and offered to be surety that he should
not quit the place, but should come forward at any time to answer
whatever charge might be brought against him; and he is now in my
house, though guest I cannot call him, for he is not of the
slightest advantage to me, as his very food is daily brought from
the country, and that <a name="page1_244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>consists only of a few eggs and a
little milk and bread.&nbsp; As for his money, I have never seen
the colour of it, notwithstanding they tell me that he has
<i>buenas pesetas</i>.&nbsp; However, he is a holy man, is
continually reading and praying, and is, moreover, of the right
opinion.&nbsp; I therefore keep him in my house, and would be
bail for him were he twenty times more of a skinflint than he
seems to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, as I was again passing through the corridor, I
observed the old man in the same place, and saluted him.&nbsp; He
returned my salutation with much courtesy, and closing the book,
placed it upon his knee, as if willing to enter into
conversation.&nbsp; After exchanging a word or two, I took up the
book for the purpose of inspecting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will hardly derive much instruction from that book,
<i>Don Jorge</i>,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you cannot
understand it, for it is not written in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor in Spanish,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But with
respect to understanding the book, I cannot see what difficulty
there can be in a thing so simple; it is only the Roman breviary
written in the Latin tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the English understand Latin?&rdquo; exclaimed
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>!&nbsp; Who would have thought that
it was possible for Lutherans to understand the language of the
church?&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>! the longer one lives the more one
learns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old may your reverence be?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am eighty years, <i>Don Jorge</i>; eighty years, and
somewhat more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the first conversation which passed between his
reverence and myself.&nbsp; He soon conceived no inconsiderable
liking for me, and favoured me with no little of his
company.&nbsp; Unlike our friend the landlord, <a
name="page1_245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>I found
him by no means inclined to talk politics, which the more
surprised me, knowing, as I did, the decided and hazardous part
which he had taken on the late Carlist irruption into the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He took, however, great delight in
discoursing on ecclesiastical subjects and the writings of the
fathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got a small library at home, <i>Don Jorge</i>,
which consists of all the volumes of the fathers which I have
been able to pick up, and I find the perusal of them a source of
great amusement and comfort.&nbsp; Should these dark days pass
by, <i>Don Jorge</i>, and you should be in these parts, I hope
you will look in upon me, and I will show you my little library
of the fathers, and likewise my dovecote, where I rear numerous
broods of pigeons, which are also a source of much solace, and at
the same time of profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose by your dovecote,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you
mean your parish, and by rearing broods of pigeons, you allude to
the care you take of the souls of your people, instilling therein
the fear of God and obedience to his revealed law, which
occupation must of course afford you much solace and spiritual
profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not speaking metaphorically, <i>Don
Jorge</i>,&rdquo; replied my companion; &ldquo;and by rearing
doves, I mean neither more nor less than that I supply the market
of Cordova with pigeons, and occasionally that of Seville; for my
birds are very celebrated, and plumper or fatter flesh than
theirs I believe cannot be found in the whole kingdom.&nbsp;
Should you come to my village, you will doubtless taste them,
<i>Don Jorge</i>, at the <i>venta</i> where you will put up, for
I suffer no dovecotes but my own within my district.&nbsp; With
respect to the souls of my parishioners, I trust I do my
duty&mdash;I trust I do, as far as in my power lies.&nbsp; I <a
name="page1_246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>always
took great pleasure in these spiritual matters, and it was on
that account that I attached myself to the <i>Santa Casa</i> <a
name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a> of Cordova, the duties of which I
assisted to perform for a long period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reverence has been an inquisitor?&rdquo; I
exclaimed, somewhat startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my thirtieth year until the time of the
suppression of the holy office in these afflicted
kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both surprise and delight me,&rdquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing could have afforded me greater
pleasure than to find myself conversing with a father formerly
attached to the holy house of Cordova.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at me steadfastly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
understand you, <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; I have long seen that you
are one of us.&nbsp; You are a learned and holy man; and though
you think fit to call yourself a Lutheran and an Englishman, I
have dived into your real condition.&nbsp; No Lutheran would take
the interest in church matters which you do, and with respect to
your being an Englishman, none of that nation can speak
Castilian, much less Latin.&nbsp; I believe you to be one of
us&mdash;a missionary priest; and I am especially confirmed in
that idea by your frequent conversation and interviews with the
<i>Gitanos</i>; you appear to be labouring among them.&nbsp; Be,
however, on your guard, <i>Don Jorge</i>; trust not to Egyptian
faith; they are evil penitents, whom I like not.&nbsp; I would
not advise you to trust them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not intend,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;especially
with money.&nbsp; But to return to more important
matters:&mdash;of what crimes did this holy house of Cordova take
cognizance?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;You are of course aware of the matters on which
the holy office exercises its functions.&nbsp; I need scarcely
mention sorcery, Judaism, and certain carnal
misdemeanours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to sorcery,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what is
your opinion of it?&nbsp; Is there in reality such a
crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Que s&eacute; yo</i>?&rdquo; <a
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247"
class="citation">[247]</a> said the old man, shrugging up his
shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;How should I know?&nbsp; The church has
power, <i>Don Jorge</i>, or at least it had power, to punish for
anything, real or unreal; and, as it was necessary to punish in
order to prove that it had the power of punishing, of what
consequence whether it punished for sorcery or any other
crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did many cases of sorcery occur within your own sphere
of knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two, <i>Don Jorge</i>: they were by no means
frequent.&nbsp; The last that I remember was a case which
occurred in a convent at Seville.&nbsp; A certain nun was in the
habit of flying through the windows and about the garden over the
tops of the orange-trees.&nbsp; Declarations of various witnesses
were taken, and the process was arranged with much formality: the
fact, I believe, was satisfactorily proved.&nbsp; Of one thing I
am certain, that the nun was punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you troubled with much Judaism in these
parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wooh!&nbsp; Nothing gave so much trouble to the
<i>Santa Casa</i> as this same Judaism.&nbsp; Its shoots and
ramifications are numerous, not only in these parts, but in all
Spain; and it is singular enough, that, even among the
priesthood, instances of Judaism of both kinds were continually
coming to our knowledge, which it was of course our duty to
punish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;Is there more than one species of
Judaism?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always arranged Judaism under two heads,&rdquo;
said the old man, &ldquo;the black and the white: by the black, I
mean the observance of the law of Moses in preference to the
precepts of the church; then there is the white Judaism, which
includes all kinds of heresy, such as Lutheranism, freemasonry,
and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily conceive,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that many
of the priesthood favoured the principles of the Reformation, and
that the minds of not a few had been led astray by the deceitful
lights of modern philosophy, but it is almost inconceivable to me
that there should be Jews amongst the priesthood who follow in
secret the rites and observances of the old law, though I confess
that I have been assured of the fact ere now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of Judaism amongst the priesthood, whether of
the black or white species; no lack of it, I assure you, <i>Don
Jorge</i>.&nbsp; I remember once searching the house of an
ecclesiastic who was accused of the black Judaism, and, after
much investigation, we discovered beneath the floor a wooden
chest, in which was a small shrine of silver, inclosing three
books in black hog-skin, which, on being opened, were found to be
books of Jewish devotion, written in Hebrew characters, and of
great antiquity; and on being questioned, the culprit made no
secret of his guilt, but rather gloried in it, saying that there
was no God but one, and denouncing the adoration of <i>Maria
Sant&iacute;sima</i> as rank idolatry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And between ourselves, what is your own opinion of the
adoration of this same <i>Maria Sant&iacute;sima</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is my opinion!&nbsp; <i>Que s&eacute;
yo</i>?&rdquo; said the old man, shrugging up his shoulders still
higher than on <a name="page1_249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>the former occasion; &ldquo;but I will tell you.&nbsp;
I think, on consideration, that it is quite right and proper; why
not?&nbsp; Let any one pay a visit to my church, and look at her
as she stands there, <i>tan bonita</i>, <i>tan guapita</i> <a
name="citation249a"></a><a href="#footnote249a"
class="citation">[249a]</a>&mdash;so well dressed and so
genteel&mdash;with such pretty colours, such red and white, and
he would scarcely ask me why <i>Maria Sant&iacute;sima</i> should
not be adored.&nbsp; Moreover, <i>Don Jorgito mio</i>, this is a
church matter, and forms an important part of the church
system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, with respect to carnal misdemeanours.&nbsp;
Did you take much cognizance of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst the laity, not much; we, however, kept a
vigilant eye upon our own body; but, upon the whole, were rather
tolerant in these matters, knowing that the infirmities of human
nature are very great indeed.&nbsp; We rarely punished, save in
cases where the glory of the church and loyalty to <i>Maria
Sant&iacute;sima</i> made punishment absolutely
imperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what cases might those be?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allude to the desecration of dovecotes, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, and the introduction therein of strange flesh, for
purposes neither seemly nor convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reverence will excuse me for not yet perfectly
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, <i>Don Jorge</i>, certain acts of
flagitiousness practised by the clergy in lone and remote
<i>palomares</i> in olive-grounds and gardens; actions denounced,
I believe, by the holy Pablo in his first letter to Pope Sixtus.
<a name="citation249b"></a><a href="#footnote249b"
class="citation">[249b]</a>&nbsp; You understand me now, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, for you are learned in church matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand you,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p><a name="page1_250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>After remaining several days more at Cordova, I
determined to proceed on my journey to Madrid, though the roads
were still said to be highly insecure.&nbsp; I, however, saw but
little utility in tarrying and awaiting a more tranquil state of
affairs, which might never arrive.&nbsp; I therefore consulted
with the landlord respecting the best means of making the
journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Don Jorgito</i>,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I think I can tell you.&nbsp; You say you are anxious to
depart, and I never wish to keep guests in my house longer than
is agreeable to them; to do so would not become a Christian
innkeeper.&nbsp; I leave such conduct to Moors, <i>Cristinos</i>,
and <i>Negros</i>.&nbsp; I will further you on your journey,
<i>Don Jorge</i>: I have a plan in my head which I had resolved
to propose to you before you questioned me.&nbsp; There is my
wife&rsquo;s brother, who has two horses which he occasionally
lets out for hire; you shall hire them, <i>Don Jorge</i>, and he
himself shall attend you to take care of you and to comfort you,
and to talk to you, and you shall pay him forty dollars for the
journey.&nbsp; Moreover, as there are thieves upon the route, and
<i>malos sujetos</i> <a name="citation250"></a><a
href="#footnote250" class="citation">[250]</a> such as Palillos
and his family, you shall make an engagement and a covenant,
<i>Don Jorge</i>, that provided you are robbed and stripped on
the route, and the horses of my wife&rsquo;s brother are taken
from him by the thieves, you shall, on arriving at Madrid, make
good any losses to which my wife&rsquo;s brother may be subject
in following you.&nbsp; This is my plan, <i>Don Jorge</i>, which
no doubt will meet with your worship&rsquo;s approbation, as it
is devised solely for your benefit, and not with any view of
lucre or interest either to me or mine.&nbsp; You will find my
wife&rsquo;s brother pleasant company on the route; he is a very
respectable man, and one of the <a name="page1_251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>right opinion, and has likewise
travelled much; for between ourselves, <i>Don Jorge</i>, he is
something of a <i>contrabandista</i>, and frequently smuggles
diamonds and precious stones from Portugal, which he disposes of
sometimes in Cordova and sometimes at Madrid.&nbsp; He is
acquainted with all the short cuts, all the <i>atajos</i>, <i>Don
Jorge</i>, and is much respected in all the <i>ventas</i> and
<i>posadas</i> on the way.&nbsp; So now give me your hand upon
the bargain, and I will forthwith repair to my wife&rsquo;s
brother to tell him to get ready to set out with your worship the
day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page1_252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Departure from Cordova&mdash;The
Contrabandista&mdash;Jewish Cunning&mdash;Arrival at Madrid.</p>
<p>One fine morning I departed from Cordova, in company with the
<i>contrabandista</i>; the latter was mounted on a handsome
animal, something between a horse and a pony, which he called a
<i>jaca</i>, of that breed for which Cordova is celebrated.&nbsp;
It was of a bright bay colour, with a star in its forehead, with
strong but elegant limbs, and a long black tail which swept the
ground.&nbsp; The other animal, which was destined to carry me to
Madrid, was not quite so prepossessing in its appearance.&nbsp;
In more than one respect it closely resembled a hog, particularly
in the curving of its back, the shortness of its neck, and the
manner in which it kept its head nearly in contact with the
ground; it had also the tail of a hog, and meandered over the
ground much like one.&nbsp; Its coat more resembled coarse
bristles than hair; and with respect to size, I have seen many a
Westphalian hog quite as tall.&nbsp; I was not altogether
satisfied with the idea of exhibiting myself on the back of this
most extraordinary quadruped, and looked wistfully on the
respectable animal on which my guide had thought proper to place
himself.&nbsp; He interpreted my glances, and gave me to <a
name="page1_253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>understand that as he was destined to carry the
baggage, he was entitled to the best horse&mdash;a plea too well
grounded on reason for me to make any objection to it.</p>
<p>I found the <i>contrabandista</i> by no means such pleasant
company on the road as I had been led to suppose he would prove
from the representation of my host of Cordova.&nbsp; Throughout
the day he sat sullen and silent, and rarely replied to my
questions, save by a monosyllable; at night, however, after
having eaten well and drunk proportionably at my expense, he
would occasionally become more sociable and communicative.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have given up smuggling,&rdquo; said he, on one of these
occasions, &ldquo;owing to a trick which was played upon me the
last time that I was at Lisbon: a Jew, whom I had been long
acquainted with, palmed upon me a false brilliant for a real
stone.&nbsp; He effected it in the most extraordinary manner, for
I am not such a novice as not to know a true diamond when I see
one; but the Jew appears to have had two, with which he played
most adroitly, keeping the valuable one for which I bargained,
and substituting therefor another which, though an excellent
imitation, was not worth four dollars.&nbsp; I did not discover
the trick until I was across the border, and upon my hurrying
back, the culprit was not to be found; his priest, however, told
me that he was just dead and buried, which was of course false,
as I saw him laughing in the corners of his eyes.&nbsp; I
renounced the contraband trade from that moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not my intention to describe minutely the various
incidents of this journey.&nbsp; Leaving at our right the
mountains of Jaen, we passed through Andujar and Bailen, and on
the third day reached Carolina, a small but beautiful town on the
skirts of the <a name="page1_254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>Sierra Morena, inhabited by the descendants of German
colonists.&nbsp; Two leagues from this place we entered the
defile of Despe&ntilde;aperros, which, even in quiet times, has
an evil name, on account of the robberies which are continually
being perpetrated within its recesses, but at the period of which
I am speaking, it was said to be swarming with banditti.&nbsp; We
of course expected to be robbed, perhaps stripped and otherwise
ill treated; but Providence here manifested itself.&nbsp; It
appeared that the day before our arrival, the banditti of the
pass had committed a dreadful robbery and murder, by which they
gained forty thousand <i>reals</i>. <a name="citation254a"></a><a
href="#footnote254a" class="citation">[254a]</a>&nbsp; This booty
probably contented them for a time: certain it is that we were
not interrupted.&nbsp; We did not even see a single individual in
the pass, though we occasionally heard whistles and loud
cries.&nbsp; We entered La Mancha, where I expected to fall into
the hands of Palillos and Orejita. <a name="citation254b"></a><a
href="#footnote254b" class="citation">[254b]</a>&nbsp; Providence
again showed itself.&nbsp; It had been delicious weather;
suddenly the Lord breathed forth a frozen blast, the severity of
which was almost intolerable.&nbsp; No human being but ourselves
ventured forth.&nbsp; We traversed snow-covered plains, and
passed through villages and towns to all appearance
deserted.&nbsp; The robbers kept close in their caves and hovels,
but the cold nearly killed us.&nbsp; We reached Aranjuez late on
Christmas-day, and I got into the house of an Englishman, where I
swallowed nearly a pint of brandy: it affected me no more than
warm water.</p>
<p><a name="page1_255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>On
the following day we arrived at Madrid, where we had the good
fortune to find everything tranquil and quiet.&nbsp; The
<i>contrabandista</i> continued with me for two days, at the end
of which time he returned to Cordova upon the uncouth animal on
which I had ridden throughout the journey.&nbsp; I had myself
purchased the <i>jaca</i>, whose capabilities I had seen on the
route, and which I imagined might prove useful in future
journeys.&nbsp; The <i>contrabandista</i> was so satisfied with
the price which I gave him for his beast, and the general
treatment which he had experienced at my hands during the time of
his attendance upon me, that he would fain have persuaded me to
retain him as a servant, assuring me that, in the event of my
compliance, he would forget his wife and children and follow me
through the world.&nbsp; I declined, however, to accede to his
request, though I was in need of a domestic; I therefore sent him
back to Cordova, where, as I subsequently learned, he died
suddenly, about a week after his return.</p>
<p>The manner of his death was singular: one day he took out his
purse, and, after counting his money, said to his wife, &ldquo;I
have made ninety-five dollars by this journey with the Englishman
and by the sale of the <i>jaca</i>; this I could easily double by
one successful venture in the smuggling lay.&nbsp; To-morrow I
will depart for Lisbon to buy diamonds.&nbsp; I wonder if the
beast requires to be shod?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then started up and
made for the door, with the intention of going to the stable;
ere, however, his foot had crossed the threshold, he fell dead on
the floor.&nbsp; Such is the course of the world.&nbsp; Well said
the wise king, &ldquo;Let no one boast of the morrow.&rdquo;</p>

Diaz&mdash;Printing of the Testament&mdash;My
Project&mdash;Andalusian Steed&mdash;Servant wanted&mdash;An
Application&mdash;Antonio Buchini&mdash;General
Cordova&mdash;Principles of Honour.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Madrid I did not repair to my former lodgings
in the Calle de la Zarza, but took others in the Calle de
Santiago, in the vicinity of the palace.&nbsp; The name of the
hostess (for there was, properly speaking, no host) was Maria
Diaz, of whom I shall take the present opportunity of saying
something in particular.</p>
<p>She was a woman of about thirty-five years of age, rather
good-looking, and with a physiognomy every lineament of which
bespoke intelligence of no common order.&nbsp; Her eyes were keen
and penetrating, though occasionally clouded with a somewhat
melancholy expression.&nbsp; There was a particular calmness and
quiet in her general demeanour, beneath which, however, slumbered
a firmness of spirit and an energy of action which were instantly
displayed whenever necessary.&nbsp; A Spaniard, and, of course, a
Catholic, she was possessed of a spirit of toleration and
liberality which would have done honour to individuals much her
superior in station.&nbsp; In this woman, <a
name="page1_257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>during
the remainder of my sojourn in Spain, I found a firm and constant
friend, and occasionally a most discreet adviser.&nbsp; She
entered into all my plans, I will not say with enthusiasm, which,
indeed, formed no part of her character, but with cordiality and
sincerity, forwarding them to the utmost of her ability.&nbsp;
She never shrank from me in the hour of danger and persecution,
but stood my friend notwithstanding the many inducements which
were held out to her by my enemies to desert or betray me.&nbsp;
Her motives were of the noblest kind&mdash;friendship, and a
proper feeling of the duties of hospitality: no prospect, no hope
of self-interest, however remote, influenced this admirable woman
in her conduct towards me.&nbsp; Honour to Maria Diaz, the quiet,
dauntless, clever Castilian female!&nbsp; I were an ingrate not
to speak well of her, for richly has she deserved an eulogy in
the humble pages of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
<p>She was a native of Villa Seca, a hamlet of New Castile,
situated in what is called the Sagra, <a
name="citation257"></a><a href="#footnote257"
class="citation">[257]</a> at about three leagues&rsquo; distance
from Toledo.&nbsp; Her father was an architect of some celebrity,
particularly skilled in erecting bridges.&nbsp; At a very early
age she married a respectable yeoman of Villa Seca, Lopez by
name, by whom she had three sons.&nbsp; On the death of her
father, which occurred about five years previous to the time of
which I am speaking, she removed to Madrid, <a
name="page1_258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>partly
for the purpose of educating her children, and partly in the hope
of obtaining from the government a considerable sum of money for
which it stood indebted to her father at the time of his decease,
for various useful and ornamental works, principally in the
neighbourhood of Aranjuez.&nbsp; The justness of her claim was at
once acknowledged; but, alas! no money was forthcoming, the royal
treasury being empty.&nbsp; Her hopes of earthly happiness were
now concentrated in her children.&nbsp; The two youngest were
still of a very tender age; but the eldest, Juan Jos&eacute;
Lopez, a lad of about sixteen, was bidding fair to realize the
warmest hopes of his affectionate mother.&nbsp; He had devoted
himself to the arts, in which he had made such progress that he
had already become the favourite pupil of his celebrated namesake
Lopez, <a name="citation258"></a><a href="#footnote258"
class="citation">[258]</a> the best painter of modern
Spain.&nbsp; Such was Maria Diaz, who, according to a custom
formerly universal in Spain, and still very prevalent, retained
the name of her maidenhood though married.&nbsp; Such was Maria
Diaz and her family.</p>
<p>One of my first cares was to wait on Mr. Villiers, who
received me with his usual kindness.&nbsp; I asked him whether he
considered that I might venture to commence printing the
Scriptures without any more applications to government.&nbsp; His
reply was satisfactory: &ldquo;You obtained the permission of the
government of Isturitz,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which was a much
less liberal one than the present.&nbsp; I am a witness to the
promise made to you by the former ministers, which I consider
sufficient.&nbsp; You had best commence and complete the <a
name="page1_259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>work as
soon as possible, without any fresh application; and should any
one attempt to interrupt you, you have only to come to me, whom
you may command at any time.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I went away with a
light heart, and forthwith made preparation for the execution of
the object which had brought me to Spain.</p>
<p>I shall not enter here into unnecessary details, which could
possess but little interest for the reader; suffice it to say
that, within three months from this time, an edition of the New
Testament, consisting of five thousand copies, was published at
Madrid.&nbsp; The work was printed at the establishment of Mr.
Borrego, <a name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a"
class="citation">[259a]</a> a well-known writer on political
economy, and proprietor and editor of an influential newspaper
called <i>El Espa&ntilde;ol</i>.&nbsp; To this gentleman I had
been recommended by Isturitz himself, on the day of my interview
with him.&nbsp; That unfortunate minister had, indeed, the
highest esteem for Borrego, and had intended raising him to the
station of minister of finance, when the revolution of La Granja
occurring, of course rendered abortive this project, with perhaps
many others of a similar kind which he might have formed.</p>
<p>The Spanish version of the New Testament which was thus
published had been made many years before by a certain Padre
Filipe Scio, <a name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b"
class="citation">[259b]</a> confessor of Ferdinand the Seventh,
and had even been printed, but so encumbered by notes and
commentaries as to be unfitted for general circulation, for
which, indeed, it was never intended.&nbsp; In the present
edition the notes were of course omitted, and the inspired word,
and that alone, offered to the public.&nbsp; It was brought out
in a <a name="page1_260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>handsome octavo volume, and presented, upon the whole,
a rather favourable specimen of Spanish typography.&nbsp; The
mere printing, however, of the New Testament at Madrid could be
attended with no utility whatever, unless measures, and energetic
ones, were taken for the circulation of the sacred volume.</p>
<p>In the case of the New Testament it would not do to follow the
usual plan of publication in Spain, namely, to entrust the work
to the booksellers of the capital, and rest content with the sale
which they and their agents in the provincial towns might be able
to obtain for it in the common routine of business; the result
generally being the circulation of a few dozen copies in the
course of the year: as the demand for literature of every kind in
Spain was miserably small.</p>
<p>The Christians of England had already made considerable
sacrifices in the hope of disseminating the word of God largely
amongst the Spaniards, and it was now necessary to spare no
exertion to prevent that hope becoming abortive.&nbsp; Before the
book was ready I had begun to make preparations for putting a
plan into execution, which had occupied my thoughts occasionally
during my former visit to Spain, and which I had never
subsequently abandoned.&nbsp; I had mused on it when off Cape
Finisterre in the tempest, in the cut-throat passes of the Sierra
Morena, and on the plains of La Mancha, as I jogged along a
little way ahead of the <i>contrabandista</i>.</p>
<p>I had determined, after depositing a certain number of copies
in the shops of the booksellers of Madrid, to ride forth,
Testament in hand, and endeavour to circulate the word of God
amongst the Spaniards, not only of the towns, but of the
villages; amongst the children not only of the plains, but of the
hills and mountains.&nbsp; <a name="page1_261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>I intended to visit Old Castile, and
to traverse the whole of Galicia and the Asturias; to establish
Scripture dep&ocirc;ts in the principal towns, and to visit the
people in secret and secluded spots; to talk to them of Christ,
to explain to them the nature of His book, and to place that book
in the hands of those whom I should deem capable of deriving
benefit from it.&nbsp; I was aware that such a journey would be
attended with considerable danger, and very possibly the fate of
St. Stephen might overtake me; but does the man deserve the name
of a follower of Christ who would shrink from danger of any kind
in the cause of Him whom he calls his Master?&nbsp; &ldquo;He who
loses his life for my sake shall find it,&rdquo; are words which
the Lord Himself uttered.&nbsp; These words were fraught with
consolation to me, as they doubtless are to every one engaged in
propagating the Gospel in sincerity of heart, in savage and
barbarian lands. . . .</p>
<p>I now purchased another horse; for these animals, at the time
of which I am speaking, were exceedingly cheap.&nbsp; A royal
requisition was about to be issued for five thousand, the
consequence being that an immense number were for sale, for, by
virtue of this requisition, the horses of any person not a
foreigner could be seized for the benefit of the service.&nbsp;
It was probable that, when the number was made up, the price of
horses would be treble what it then was, which consideration
induced me to purchase this animal before I exactly wanted
him.&nbsp; He was a black Andalusian stallion <a
name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261"
class="citation">[261]</a> of great power and strength, and
capable of performing a journey of a hundred leagues in a
week&rsquo;s time; but he was unbroke, savage, and furious.&nbsp;
A cargo of Bibles, however, which I hoped occasionally <a
name="page1_262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>to put on
his back, would, I had no doubt, thoroughly tame him, especially
when labouring up the flinty hills of the north of Spain.&nbsp; I
wished to have purchased a mule, but, though I offered thirty
pounds for a sorry one, I could not obtain her; whereas the cost
of both the horses&mdash;tall, powerful, stately
animals&mdash;scarcely amounted to that sum.</p>
<p>The state of the surrounding country at this time was not very
favourable for venturing forth.&nbsp; Cabrera <a
name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a> was within nine leagues of Madrid,
with an army nearly ten thousand strong; he had beaten several
small detachments of the queen&rsquo;s troops, and had ravaged La
Mancha with fire and sword, burning several towns.&nbsp; Bands of
affrighted fugitives were arriving every hour, bringing tidings
of woe and disaster; and I was only surprised that the enemy did
not appear, and by taking Madrid, which was almost at his mercy,
put an end to the war at once.&nbsp; But the truth is, that the
Carlist generals did not wish the war to cease, for as long as
the country was involved in bloodshed and anarchy they could
plunder, and exercise that lawless authority so dear to men of
fierce and brutal passions.&nbsp; Cabrera, moreover, was a
dastardly wretch, whose limited mind was incapable of harbouring
a single conception approaching to grandeur&mdash;whose heroic
deeds were confined to cutting down defenceless men, and to
forcing and disembowelling unhappy women; and yet I have seen
this wretched fellow termed by French journals (Carlist, of
course) the young, the heroic general!&nbsp; Infamy on the
cowardly assassin!&nbsp; The shabbiest corporal of <a
name="page1_263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>Napoleon
would have laughed at his generalship, and half a battalion of
Austrian grenadiers would have driven him and his rabble army
headlong into the Ebro. <a name="citation263"></a><a
href="#footnote263" class="citation">[263]</a></p>
<p>I now made preparations for my journey into the north.&nbsp; I
was already provided with horses well calculated to support the
fatigues of the road and the burdens which I might deem necessary
to impose upon them.&nbsp; One thing, however, was still lacking,
indispensable to a person about to engage on an expedition of
this description; I mean a servant to attend me.&nbsp; Perhaps
there is no place in the world where servants more abound than at
Madrid, or at least fellows eager to proffer their services in
the expectation of receiving food and wages, though, with respect
to the actual service which they are capable of performing, not
much can be said; but I was in want of a servant of no common
description, a shrewd active fellow, of whose advice, in cases of
emergency, I could occasionally avail myself; courageous withal,
for it certainly required some degree of courage to follow a
master bent on exploring the greater part of Spain, and who
intended to travel, not under the protection of muleteers and
carmen, but on his own <i>cabalgaduras</i>.&nbsp; Such a servant,
perhaps, I might have sought for years without finding; chance,
however, brought one to my hand at the very time I wanted him,
without it being necessary for me to make any laborious
perquisitions.&nbsp; I was one day mentioning the subject to Mr.
Borrego, at whose establishment I had printed the New Testament,
and inquiring whether he thought that such an individual was to
<a name="page1_264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>be
found in Madrid, adding that I was particularly anxious to obtain
a servant who, besides Spanish, could speak some other language,
that occasionally we might discourse without being understood by
those who might overhear us.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very description of
person,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that you appear to be in need
of, quitted me about half an hour ago, and, it is singular
enough, came to me in the hope that I might be able to recommend
him to a master.&nbsp; He has been twice in my service: for his
talent and courage I will answer; and I believe him to be
trustworthy, at least to masters who may chime in with his
humour, for I must inform you that he is a most extraordinary
fellow, full of strange likes and antipathies, which he will
gratify at any expense, either to himself or others.&nbsp;
Perhaps he will attach himself to you, in which case you will
find him highly valuable; for, if he please, he can turn his hand
to anything, and is not only acquainted with two, but half a
dozen languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a Spaniard?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send him to you to-morrow,&rdquo; said Borrego,
&ldquo;you will best learn from his own mouth who and what he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, as I had just sat down to my <i>sopa</i>, my
hostess informed me that a man wished to speak to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said I, and he almost instantly made his
appearance.&nbsp; He was dressed respectably in the French
fashion, and had rather a juvenile look, though I subsequently
learned that he was considerably above forty.&nbsp; He was
somewhat above the middle stature, and might have been called
well made, had it not been for his meagreness, which was rather
remarkable.&nbsp; His arms were long and bony, and his <a
name="page1_265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>whole
form conveyed an idea of great activity united with no slight
degree of strength.&nbsp; His hair was wiry, but of jetty
blackness; his forehead low; his eyes small and grey, expressive
of much subtlety and no less malice, strangely relieved by a
strong dash of humour; the nose was handsome, but the mouth was
immensely wide, and his under jaw projected considerably.&nbsp; A
more singular physiognomy I had never seen, and I continued
staring at him for some time in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo; I at last demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domestic in search of a master,&rdquo; answered the man
in good French, but in a strange accent.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come
recommended to you, my Lor, by <i>Monsieur</i> B---.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of what nation may you be?&nbsp; Are you
French or Spanish?</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&mdash;God forbid that I should be either, <i>mi
Lor</i>; <i>j&rsquo;ai l&rsquo;honneur d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre de la
nation Grecque</i>; my name is Antonio Buchini, native of Pera
the Belle, <a name="citation265a"></a><a href="#footnote265a"
class="citation">[265a]</a> near to Constantinople.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what brought you to Spain?</p>
<p><i>Buchini</i>.&mdash;<i>Mi Lor</i>, <i>je vais vous raconter
mon histoire du commencement jusqu&rsquo;ici</i>.&nbsp; My father
was a native of Sceira, <a name="citation265b"></a><a
href="#footnote265b" class="citation">[265b]</a> in Greece, from
whence at an early age he repaired to Pera, where he served as
janitor in the hotels of various ambassadors, by whom he was much
respected for his fidelity.&nbsp; Amongst others of these
gentlemen, he served him of your own nation: this occurred at the
time that there was war between <a name="page1_266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>England and the Porte. <a
name="citation266a"></a><a href="#footnote266a"
class="citation">[266a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Monsieur</i> the ambassador
had to escape for his life, leaving the greater part of his
valuables to the care of my father, who concealed them at his own
great risk, and when the dispute was settled, restored them to
monsieur, even to the most inconsiderable trinket.&nbsp; I
mention this circumstance to show you that I am of a family which
cherishes principles of honour, and in which confidence may be
placed.&nbsp; My father married a daughter of Pera, <i>et moi je
suis l&rsquo;unique fruit de ce mariage</i>.&nbsp; Of my mother I
know nothing, as she died shortly after my birth.&nbsp; A family
of wealthy Jews took pity on my forlorn condition and offered to
bring me up, to which my father gladly consented; and with them I
continued several years, until I was a <i>beau gar&ccedil;on</i>;
they were very fond of me, and at last offered to adopt me, and
at their death to bequeath me all they had, on condition of my
becoming a Jew.&nbsp; <i>Mais la circoncision
n&rsquo;&eacute;toit gu&egrave;re &agrave; mon go&ucirc;t</i>,
especially that of the Jews, for I am a Greek, am proud, and have
principles of honour.&nbsp; I quitted them, therefore, saying
that if ever I allowed myself to be converted, it should be to
the faith of the Turks, for they are men, are proud, and have
principles of honour like myself.&nbsp; I then returned to my
father, who procured me various situations, none of which were to
my liking, until I was placed in the house of <i>Monsieur</i>
Zea.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You mean, I suppose, Zea Bermudez, <a
name="citation266b"></a><a href="#footnote266b"
class="citation">[266b]</a> who chanced to be at
Constantinople.</p>
<p><a name="page1_267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span><i>Buchini</i>.&mdash;Just so, <i>mi Lor</i>, and with
him I continued during his stay.&nbsp; He put great confidence in
me, more especially as I spoke the pure Spanish language, which I
acquired amongst the Jews, who, as I have heard <i>Monsieur</i>
Zea say, speak it better than the present natives of Spain.</p>
<p>I shall not follow the Greek step by step throughout his
history, which was rather lengthy: suffice it to say, that he was
brought by Zea Bermudez from Constantinople to Spain, where he
continued in his service for many years, and from whose house he
was expelled for marrying a Guipuzcoan damsel, who was <i>fille
de chambre</i> to <i>Madame</i> Zea; since which time it appeared
that he had served an infinity of masters, sometimes as valet,
sometimes as cook, but generally in the last capacity.&nbsp; He
confessed, however, that he had seldom continued more than three
days in the same service, on account of the disputes which were
sure to arise in the house almost immediately after his
admission, and for which he could assign no other reason than his
being a Greek, and having principles of honour.&nbsp; Amongst
other persons whom he had served was General Cordova, who he said
was a bad paymaster, and was in the habit of maltreating his
domestics.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he found his match in me,&rdquo; said
Antonio, &ldquo;for I was prepared for him; and once, when he
drew his sword against me, I pulled out a pistol and pointed it
in his face.&nbsp; He grew pale as death, and from that hour
treated me with all kinds of condescension.&nbsp; It was only
pretence, however, for the affair rankled in his mind; he had
determined upon revenge, and on being appointed to the command of
the army, he was particularly anxious that I should attend him to
the camp.&nbsp; <i>Mais je lui ris au nez</i>, made <a
name="page1_268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the sign
of the <i>cortamanga</i>, <a name="citation268"></a><a
href="#footnote268" class="citation">[268]</a> asked for my
wages, and left him; and well it was that I did so, for the very
domestic whom he took with him he caused to be shot upon a charge
of mutiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you are of a
turbulent disposition, and that the disputes to which you have
alluded are solely to be attributed to the badness of your
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have, <i>Monsieur</i>?&nbsp; <i>Moi je
suis Grec</i>, <i>je suis fier</i>, <i>et j&rsquo;ai des
principes d&rsquo;honneur</i>.&nbsp; I expect to be treated with
a certain consideration, though I confess that my temper is none
of the best, and that at times I am tempted to quarrel with the
pots and pans in the kitchen.&nbsp; I think, upon the whole, that
it will be for your advantage to engage me, and I promise you to
be on my guard.&nbsp; There is one thing that pleases me relating
to you, you are unmarried.&nbsp; Now, I would rather serve a
young unmarried man for love and friendship, than a Benedick for
fifty dollars per month.&nbsp; <i>Madame</i> is sure to hate me,
and so is her waiting-woman; and more particularly the latter,
because I am a married man.&nbsp; I see that <i>mi Lor</i> is
willing to engage me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say you are a married man,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;how can you desert your wife? for I am about to leave
Madrid, and to travel into the remote and mountainous parts of
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife will receive the moiety of my wages while I am
absent, <i>mi Lor</i>, and therefore will have no reason to
complain of being deserted.&nbsp; Complain! did I say; my wife is
at present too well instructed to complain.&nbsp; She never
speaks nor sits in my presence, unless I give her
permission.&nbsp; Am I not a Greek, and <a
name="page1_269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>do I not
know how to govern my own house?&nbsp; Engage me, <i>mi Lor</i>;
I am a man of many capacities&mdash;a discreet valet, an
excellent cook, a good groom and light rider; in a word, I am
&Rho;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&#970;&kappa;&#972;&sigmaf;. <a
name="citation269a"></a><a href="#footnote269a"
class="citation">[269a]</a>&nbsp; What would you more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him his terms, which were extravagant, notwithstanding
his <i>principes d&rsquo;honneur</i>.&nbsp; I found, however,
that he was willing to take one-half.</p>
<p>I had no sooner engaged him than, seizing the tureen of soup,
which had by this time become quite cold, he placed it on the top
of his fore finger, or rather on the nail thereof, causing it to
make various circumvolutions over his head, to my great
astonishment, without spilling a drop, then springing with it to
the door, he vanished, and in another moment made his appearance
with the <i>puchera</i>, which, after a similar bound and
flourish, he deposited on the table; then suffering his hands to
sink before him, he put one over the other, and stood at his
ease, with half-shut eyes, for all the world as if he had been in
my service twenty years.</p>
<p>And in this manner Antonio Buchini entered upon his
duties.&nbsp; Many was the wild spot to which he subsequently
accompanied me; many the wild adventure of which he was the
sharer.&nbsp; His behaviour was frequently in the highest degree
extraordinary, but he served me courageously and faithfully: such
a valet, take him for all in all&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His like I ne&rsquo;er expect to see
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Illness&mdash;Nocturnal Visit&mdash;A Master

Hospitality&mdash;Spanish Soldiers&mdash;The Scriptures
advertised.</p>
<p>But I am anxious to enter upon the narrative of my journey,
and shall therefore abstain from relating to my readers a great
many circumstances which occurred previously to my leaving Madrid
on this expedition.&nbsp; About the middle of May I had got
everything in readiness, and I bade farewell to my friends.&nbsp;
Salamanca was the first place which I intended to visit.</p>
<p>Some days previous to my departure I was very much indisposed,
owing to the state of the weather, for violent and biting winds
had long prevailed.&nbsp; I had been attacked with a severe cold,
which terminated in a disagreeable cough, which the many remedies
I successively tried seemed unable to subdue.&nbsp; I had made
preparations for departing on a particular day, but, owing to the
state of my health, I was apprehensive that I should be compelled
to defer my journey for a time.&nbsp; The last day of my stay in
Madrid, finding myself scarcely able to stand, I was fain to
submit to a somewhat desperate experiment, and by the advice of
the barber-surgeon who visited me, I determined to be bled.&nbsp;
Late on the night of that <a name="page1_271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>same day he took from me sixteen
ounces of blood, and having received his fee left me, wishing me
a pleasant journey, and assuring me, upon his reputation, that by
noon the next day I should be perfectly recovered.</p>
<p>A few minutes after his departure, whilst I was sitting alone,
meditating on the journey which I was about to undertake, and on
the rickety state of my health, I heard a loud knock at the
street door of the house, on the third floor of which I was
lodged.&nbsp; In another minute Mr. S---, <a
name="citation271"></a><a href="#footnote271"
class="citation">[271]</a> of the British embassy, entered my
apartment.&nbsp; After a little conversation, he informed me that
Mr. Villiers had desired him to wait upon me to communicate a
resolution which he had come to.&nbsp; Being apprehensive that,
alone and unassisted, I should experience great difficulty in
propagating the Gospel of God to any considerable extent in
Spain, he was bent upon exerting to the utmost his own credit and
influence to further my views, which he himself considered, if
carried into proper effect, extremely well calculated to operate
beneficially on the political and moral state of the
country.&nbsp; To this end it was his intention to purchase a
very considerable number of copies of the New Testament, and to
dispatch them forthwith to the various British consuls
established in different parts of Spain, with strict and positive
orders to employ all the means which their official situation
should afford them to circulate the books in question, and to
assure their being noticed.&nbsp; They were, moreover, to be
charged to afford me, whenever I should appear in their
respective districts, all the protection, encouragement, and
assistance which I should stand in need of.&nbsp; <a
name="page1_272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>I was of
course much rejoiced on receiving this information, for, though I
had long been aware that Mr. Villiers was at all times willing to
assist me, he having frequently given me sufficient proof, I
could never expect that he would come forward in so noble, and,
to say the least of it, considering his high diplomatic
situation, so bold and decided a manner.&nbsp; I believe that
this was the first instance of a British ambassador having made
the cause of the Bible Society a national one, or indeed of
having favoured it directly or indirectly.&nbsp; What renders the
case of Mr. Villiers more remarkable is that, on my first arrival
at Madrid, I found him by no means well disposed towards the
Society.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit had probably illumined his mind on
this point.&nbsp; I hoped that by his means our institution would
shortly possess many agents in Spain, who, with far more power
and better opportunities than I myself could ever expect to
possess, would scatter abroad the seed of the Gospel, and make of
a barren and thirsty wilderness a green and smiling
corn-field.</p>
<p>A word or two about the gentleman who paid me this nocturnal
visit.&nbsp; Though he has probably long since forgotten the
humble circulator of the Bible in Spain, I still bear in mind
numerous acts of kindness which I experienced at his hands.&nbsp;
Endowed with an intellect of the highest order, master of the
lore of all Europe, profoundly versed in the ancient tongues and
speaking most of the modern dialects with remarkable
facility&mdash;possessed, moreover, of a thorough knowledge of
mankind&mdash;he brought with him into the diplomatic career
advantages such as few, even the most highly gifted, can boast
of.&nbsp; During his sojourn in Spain he performed many eminent
services for the government <a name="page1_273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>which employed him; services which,
I believe, it had sufficient discernment to see, and gratitude to
reward.&nbsp; He had to encounter, however, the full brunt of the
low and stupid malignity of the party who, shortly after the time
of which I am speaking, usurped the management of the affairs of
Spain.&nbsp; This party, whose foolish man&oelig;uvres he was
continually discomfiting, feared and hated him as its evil
genius, taking every opportunity of showering on his head
calumnies the most improbable and absurd.&nbsp; Amongst other
things, he was accused of having acted as an agent to the English
government in the affair of La Granja, bringing about that
revolution by bribing the mutinous soldiers, and more
particularly the notorious Sergeant Garcia.&nbsp; Such an
accusation will of course merely extract a smile from those who
are at all acquainted with the English character, and the general
line of conduct pursued by the English government.&nbsp; It was a
charge, however, universally believed in Spain, and was even
preferred in print by a certain journal, the official organ of
the silly Duke of Frias, one of the many prime ministers of the
<i>moderado</i> party who followed each other in rapid succession
towards the latter period of the Carlist and <i>Cristino</i>
struggle.&nbsp; But when did a calumnious report ever fall to the
ground in Spain by the weight of its own absurdity?&nbsp; Unhappy
land! not until the pure light of the Gospel has illumined thee,
wilt thou learn that the greatest of all gifts is charity!</p>
<p>The next day verified the prediction of the Spanish surgeon; I
had to a considerable degree lost my cough and fever, though,
owing to the loss of blood, I was somewhat feeble.&nbsp;
Precisely at twelve o&rsquo;clock the horses were led forth
before the door of my lodging <a name="page1_274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>in the Calle de Santiago, and I
prepared to mount; but my black <i>entero</i> of Andalusia would
not permit me to approach his side, and, whenever I made the
attempt, commenced wheeling round with great rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est un mauvais signe</i>, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio, who, dressed in a green
jerkin, a <i>montero</i> cap, and booted and spurred, stood ready
to attend me, holding by the bridle the horse which I had
purchased from the <i>contrabandista</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
bad sign, and in my country they would defer the journey till
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there whisperers in your country?&rdquo; I
demanded; and taking the horse by the mane, I performed the
ceremony after the most approved fashion.&nbsp; The animal stood
still, and I mounted the saddle, exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>Romany chal</i> <a
name="citation274a"></a><a href="#footnote274a"
class="citation">[274a]</a> to his horse did cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he placed the bit in his horse&rsquo;s jaw,<br />
&lsquo;Kosko gry!&nbsp; Romany gry!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Muk man kistur tute knaw.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation274b"></a><a href="#footnote274b"
class="citation">[274b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We then rode forth from Madrid by the gate of San Vicente,
directing our course to the lofty mountains which separate Old
from New Castile.&nbsp; That night we rested at Guadarrama, a
large village at their foot, distant from Madrid about seven
leagues.&nbsp; Rising early on the following morning, we ascended
the pass and entered into Old Castile.</p>
<p>After crossing the mountains, the route to Salamanca lies
almost entirely over sandy and arid plains, interspersed here and
there with thin and scanty groves of pine.&nbsp; No adventure
worth relating occurred during <a name="page1_275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>this journey.&nbsp; We sold a few
Testaments in the villages through which we passed, more
especially at Pe&ntilde;aranda.&nbsp; About noon of the third
day, on reaching the brow of a hillock, we saw a huge dome before
us, upon which the fierce rays of the sun striking, produced the
appearance of burnished gold.&nbsp; It belonged to the cathedral
of Salamanca, and we flattered ourselves that we were already at
our journey&rsquo;s end; we were deceived, however, being still
four leagues distant from the town, whose churches and convents,
towering up in gigantic masses, can be distinguished at an
immense distance, flattering the traveller with an idea of
propinquity which does not in reality exist.&nbsp; It was not
till long after nightfall that we arrived at the city gate, which
we found closed and guarded, in apprehension of a Carlist attack;
and having obtained admission with some difficulty, we led our
horses along dark, silent, and deserted streets, till we found an
individual who directed us to a large, gloomy, and comfortless
<i>posada</i>, that of the Bull, which we, however, subsequently
found was the best which the town afforded.</p>
<p>A melancholy town is Salamanca; the days of its collegiate
glory are long since past by, never more to return: a
circumstance, however, which is little to be regretted; for what
benefit did the world ever derive from scholastic
philosophy?&nbsp; And for that alone was Salamanca ever
famous.&nbsp; Its halls are now almost silent, and grass is
growing in its courts, which were once daily thronged by at least
eight thousand students; a number to which, at the present day,
the entire population of the city does not amount.&nbsp; Yet,
with all its melancholy, what an interesting, nay, what a
magnificent place is Salamanca!&nbsp; How glorious <a
name="page1_276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>are its
churches, how stupendous are its deserted convents, and with what
sublime but sullen grandeur do its huge and crumbling walls,
which crown the precipitous bank of the Tormes, look down upon
the lovely river and its venerable bridge!</p>
<p>What a pity that, of the many rivers of Spain, scarcely one is
navigable!&nbsp; The beautiful but shallow Tormes, instead of
proving a source of blessing and wealth to this part of Castile,
is of no further utility than to turn the wheels of various small
water mills, standing upon weirs of stone, which at certain
distances traverse the river.</p>
<p>My sojourn at Salamanca was rendered particularly pleasant by
the kind attentions and continual acts of hospitality which I
experienced from the inmates of the Irish College, to the rector
of which I bore a letter of recommendation from my kind and
excellent friend Mr. O&rsquo;Shea, the celebrated banker of
Madrid.&nbsp; It will be long before I forget these Irish, more
especially their head, Dr. Gartland, a genuine scion of the good
Hibernian tree, an accomplished scholar, and a courteous and
high-minded gentleman.&nbsp; Though fully aware who I was, he
held out the hand of friendship to the wandering heretic
missionary, although by so doing he exposed himself to the
rancorous remarks of the narrow-minded native clergy, who, in
their ugly shovel hats and long cloaks, glared at me askance as I
passed by their whispering groups beneath the <i>piazzas</i> of
the <i>Plaza</i>.&nbsp; But when did the fear of consequences
cause an Irishman to shrink from the exercise of the duties of
hospitality?&nbsp; However attached to his religion&mdash;and who
is so attached to the Romish creed as the Irishman?&mdash;I am
convinced that not all the authority of the Pope or the Cardinals
would induce <a name="page1_277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>him to close his doors on Luther himself, were that
respectable personage at present alive and in need of food and
refuge.</p>
<p>Honour to Ireland and her &ldquo;hundred thousand
welcomes!&rdquo; <a name="citation277a"></a><a
href="#footnote277a" class="citation">[277a]</a>&nbsp; Her fields
have long been the greenest in the world; her daughters the
fairest; her sons the bravest and most eloquent.&nbsp; May they
never cease to be so!</p>
<p>The <i>posada</i> where I had put up was a good specimen of
the old Spanish inn, being much the same as those described in
the time of Philip the Third or Fourth.&nbsp; The rooms were many
and large, floored with either brick or stone, generally with an
alcove at the end, in which stood a wretched flock bed.&nbsp;
Behind the house was a court, and in the rear of this a stable,
full of horses, ponies, mules, <i>machos</i>, and donkeys, for
there was no lack of guests, who, however, for the most part
slept in the stable with their <i>caballerias</i>, being either
<i>arrieros</i> or small peddling merchants who travelled the
country with coarse cloth or linen.&nbsp; Opposite to my room in
the corridor lodged a wounded officer, who had just arrived from
San Sebastian on a galled broken-kneed pony: he was an
Estrimenian, <a name="citation277b"></a><a href="#footnote277b"
class="citation">[277b]</a> and was returning to his own village
to be cured.&nbsp; He was attended by three broken soldiers, lame
or maimed, and unfit for service: they told me that they were of
the same village as his worship, and on that account he permitted
them to travel with him.&nbsp; They slept amongst the litter, and
throughout the day lounged about the house smoking paper
cigars.&nbsp; I never saw them eating, though they frequently
went to a dark cool corner, where stood a <i>bota</i> or kind of
water pitcher, <a name="page1_278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>which they held about six inches from their black filmy
lips, permitting the liquid to trickle down their throats.&nbsp;
They said they had no pay, and were quite destitute of money,
that <i>su merced</i> the officer occasionally gave them a piece
of bread, but that he himself was poor and had only a few
dollars.&nbsp; Brave guests for an inn, thought I; yet, to the
honour of Spain be it spoken, it is one of the few countries in
Europe where poverty is never insulted nor looked upon with
contempt.&nbsp; Even at an inn, the poor man is never spurned
from the door, and if not harboured, is at least dismissed with
fair words, and consigned to the mercies of God and his
mother.&nbsp; This is as it should be.&nbsp; I laugh at the
bigotry and prejudices of Spain; I abhor the cruelty and ferocity
which have cast a stain of eternal infamy on her history; but I
will say for the Spaniards, that in their social intercourse no
people in the world exhibit a juster feeling of what is due to
the dignity of human nature, or better understand the behaviour
which it behoves a man to adopt towards his fellow beings.&nbsp;
I have said that it is one of the few countries in Europe where
poverty is not treated with contempt, and I may add, where the
wealthy are not blindly idolized.&nbsp; In Spain the very beggar
does not feel himself a degraded being, for he kisses no
one&rsquo;s feet, and knows not what it is to be cuffed or spit
upon; and in Spain the duke or the marquis can scarcely entertain
a very overweening opinion of his own consequence, as he finds no
one, with perhaps the exception of his French valet, to fawn upon
or flatter him.</p>
<p>During my stay at Salamanca I took measures that the word of
God might become generally known in his celebrated city.&nbsp;
The principal bookseller of the <a name="page1_279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>town, Blanco, a man of great wealth
and respectability, consented to become my agent here, and I in
consequence deposited in his shop a certain number of New
Testaments.&nbsp; He was the proprietor of a small
printing-press, where the official bulletin of the place was
published.&nbsp; For this bulletin I prepared an advertisement of
the work, in which, amongst other things, I said that the New
Testament was the only guide to salvation; I also spoke of the
Bible Society, and the great pecuniary sacrifices which it was
making with the view of proclaiming Christ crucified, and of
making his doctrine known.&nbsp; This step will perhaps be
considered by some as too bold, but I was not aware that I could
take any more calculated to arouse the attention of the
people&mdash;a considerable point.&nbsp; I also ordered numbers
of the same advertisement to be struck off in the shape of bills,
which I caused to be stuck up in various parts of the town.&nbsp;
I had great hope that by means of these a considerable number of
New Testaments would be sold.&nbsp; I intended to repeat this
experiment in Valladolid, Leon, St. Jago, <a
name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279"
class="citation">[279]</a> and all the principal towns which I
visited, and to distribute them likewise as I rode along.&nbsp;
The children of Spain would thus be brought to know that such a
work as the New Testament is in existence, a fact of which not
five in one hundred were then aware, notwithstanding their so
frequently repeated boasts of their Catholicity and
Christianity.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 10, I left Salamanca for Valladolid.&nbsp;
As the village where we intended to rest was only five leagues
distant, we did not sally forth till midday was past.&nbsp; There
was a haze in the heavens which overcast the sun, nearly hiding
his countenance from our view.&nbsp; My friend, Mr. Patrick
Cantwell, of the Irish College, <a name="citation280a"></a><a
href="#footnote280a" class="citation">[280a]</a> was kind enough
to ride with me part of the way.&nbsp; He was mounted on a most
sorry-looking hired mule, which I expected would be unable to
keep pace with the spirited horses of myself and man; for he
seemed to be twin-brother of the mule of Gil Perez, on which his
nephew made his celebrated journey from Oviedo to
Pe&ntilde;aflor. <a name="citation280b"></a><a
href="#footnote280b" class="citation">[280b]</a>&nbsp; I was,
however, very much mistaken.&nbsp; The creature, on being
mounted, instantly set <a name="page1_281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>off at that rapid walk which I have
so often admired in Spanish mules, and which no horse can
emulate.&nbsp; Our more stately animals were speedily left in the
rear, and we were continually obliged to break into a trot to
follow the singular quadruped, who, ever and anon, would lift his
head high in the air, curl up his lip, and show his yellow teeth,
as if he were laughing at us, as perhaps he was.&nbsp; It chanced
that none of us were well acquainted with the road; indeed, I
could see nothing which was fairly entitled to that
appellation.&nbsp; The way from Salamanca to Valladolid is
amongst a medley of bridle-paths and drift-ways, where
discrimination is very difficult.&nbsp; It was not long before we
were bewildered, and travelled over more ground than was strictly
necessary.&nbsp; However, as men and women frequently passed on
donkeys and little ponies, we were not too proud to be set right
by them, and by dint of diligent inquiry we at length arrived at
Pitiegua, four leagues from Salamanca, a small village,
containing about fifty families, consisting of mud huts, and
situated in the midst of dusty plains, where corn was growing in
abundance.&nbsp; We asked for the house of the <i>cura</i>, an
old man whom I had seen the day before at the Irish College, and
who, on being informed that I was about to depart for Valladolid,
had exacted from me a promise that I would not pass through his
village without paying him a visit and partaking of his
hospitality.</p>
<p>A woman directed us to a cottage somewhat superior in
appearance to those contiguous.&nbsp; It had a small portico,
which, if I remember well, was overgrown with a vine.&nbsp; We
knocked loud and long at the door, but received no answer; the
voice of man was silent, and not even a dog barked.&nbsp; The
truth <a name="page1_282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>was, that the old curate <a name="citation282"></a><a
href="#footnote282" class="citation">[282]</a> was taking his
<i>siesta</i>, and so were his whole family, which consisted of
one ancient female and a cat.&nbsp; The good man was at last
disturbed by our noise and vociferation, for we were hungry, and
consequently impatient.&nbsp; Leaping from his couch, he came
running to the door in great hurry and confusion, and, perceiving
us, he made many apologies for being asleep at a period when, he
said, he ought to have been on the look-out for his invited
guest.&nbsp; He embraced me very affectionately, and conducted me
into his parlour, an apartment of tolerable size, hung round with
shelves, which were crowded with books.&nbsp; At one end there
was a kind of table or desk covered with black leather, with a
large easy-chair, into which he pushed me, as I, with the true
eagerness of a bibliomaniac, was about to inspect his shelves;
saying, with considerable vehemence, that there was nothing there
worthy of the attention of an Englishman, for that his whole
stock consisted of breviaries and dry Catholic treatises on
divinity.</p>
<p>His care now was to furnish us with refreshments.&nbsp; In a
twinkling, with the assistance of his old attendant, he placed on
the table several plates of cakes and confectionery, and a number
of large uncouth glass bottles, which I thought bore a strong
resemblance to those of Schiedam, and indeed they were the very
same.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, rubbing his hands;
&ldquo;I thank God that it is in my power to treat you in a way
which will be agreeable to you.&nbsp; In those bottles there is
Hollands, thirty years old;&rdquo; and producing two large
tumblers, he continued, &ldquo;fill, my friends, and
drink&mdash;drink it every drop if you please, for it is of <a
name="page1_283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>little
use to myself, who seldom drink aught but water.&nbsp; I know
that you islanders love it, and cannot live without it;
therefore, since it does you good, I am only sorry that there is
no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing that we contented ourselves with merely tasting it,
he looked at us with astonishment, and inquired the reason of our
not drinking.&nbsp; We told him that we seldom drank ardent
spirits; and I added, that as for myself, I seldom tasted even
wine, but, like himself, was content with the use of water.&nbsp;
He appeared somewhat incredulous; but told us to do exactly what
we pleased, and to ask for what was agreeable to us.&nbsp; We
told him that we had not dined, and should be glad of some
substantial refreshment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;that I have nothing in the house which will suit you;
however, we will go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he led us through a small yard at the back part of
his house, which might have been called a garden or orchard if it
had displayed either trees or flowers; but it produced nothing
but grass, which was growing in luxuriance.&nbsp; At one end was
a large pigeon-house, which we all entered; &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
said the curate, &ldquo;if we could find some nice delicate
pigeons they would afford you an excellent dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We were, however, disappointed; for, after rummaging the nests,
we only found very young ones, unfitted for our purpose.&nbsp;
The good man became very melancholy, and said he had some
misgivings that we should have to depart dinnerless.&nbsp;
Leaving the pigeon-house, he conducted us to a place where there
were several skeps of bees, round which multitudes of the busy
insects were hovering, filling the air with their music.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Next to my fellow-creatures,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there
is <a name="page1_284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>nothing which I love so dearly as these bees; it is one
of my delights to sit watching them, and listening to their
murmur.&rdquo;&nbsp; We next went to several unfurnished rooms,
fronting the yard, in one of which were hanging several flitches
of bacon, beneath which he stopped, and, looking up, gazed
intently upon them.&nbsp; We told him that, if he had nothing
better to offer, we should be very glad to eat some slices of his
bacon, especially if some eggs were added.&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell
the truth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have nothing better, and if
you can content yourselves with such fare I shall be very happy;
as for eggs, you can have as many as you wish, and perfectly
fresh, for my hens lay every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after everything was prepared and arranged to our
satisfaction, we sat down to dine on the bacon and eggs, in a
small room, not the one to which he had ushered us at first, but
on the other side of the doorway.&nbsp; The good curate, though
he ate nothing, having taken his meal long before, sat at the
head of the table, and the repast was enlivened by his
chat.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, my friends,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;where you are now seated once sat Wellington and Crawford,
after they had beat the French at Arapiles, <a
name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a> and rescued us from the thraldom of
those wicked people.&nbsp; I never respected my house so much as
I have done since they honoured it with their presence.&nbsp;
They were heroes, and one was a demi-god.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
burst into a most eloquent panegyric of <i>El Gran Lord</i>, as
he <a name="page1_285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>termed him, which I should be very happy to translate,
were my pen capable of rendering into English the robust
thundering sentences of his powerful Castilian.&nbsp; I had till
then considered him a plain, uninformed old man, almost simple,
and as incapable of much emotion as a tortoise within its shell;
but he had become at once inspired: his eyes were replete with a
bright fire, and every muscle of his face was quivering.&nbsp;
The little silk skull-cap which he wore, according to the custom
of the Catholic clergy, moved up and down with his agitation; and
I soon saw that I was in the presence of one of those remarkable
men who so frequently spring up in the bosom of the Romish
church, and who to a child-like simplicity unite immense energy
and power of mind&mdash;equally adapted to guide a scanty flock
of ignorant rustics in some obscure village in Italy or Spain, as
to convert millions of heathens on the shores of Japan, China,
and Paraguay.</p>
<p>He was a thin spare man, of about sixty-five, and was dressed
in a black cloak of very coarse materials; nor were his other
garments of superior quality.&nbsp; This plainness, however, in
the appearance of his outward man was by no means the result of
poverty; quite the contrary.&nbsp; The benefice was a very
plentiful one, and placed at his disposal annually a sum of at
least eight hundred dollars, of which the eighth part was more
than sufficient to defray the expenses of his house and himself;
the rest was devoted entirely to the purest acts of
charity.&nbsp; He fed the hungry wanderer, and despatched him
singing on his way, with meat in his wallet and a <i>peseta</i>
in his purse; and his parishioners, when in need of money, had
only to repair to his study, and were sure of an immediate
supply.&nbsp; He <a name="page1_286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>was, indeed, the banker of the village, and what he
lent he neither expected nor wished to be returned.&nbsp; Though
under the necessity of making frequent journeys to Salamanca, he
kept no mule, but contented himself with an ass, borrowed from
the neighbouring miller.&nbsp; &ldquo;I once kept a mule,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;but some years since it was removed without my
permission by a traveller whom I had housed for the night: for in
that alcove I keep two clean beds for the use of the wayfaring,
and I shall be very much pleased if yourself and friend will
occupy them, and tarry with me till the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I was eager to continue my journey, and my friend was no
less anxious to return to Salamanca.&nbsp; Upon taking leave of
the hospitable curate, I presented him with a copy of the New
Testament.&nbsp; He received it without uttering a single word,
and placed it on one of the shelves of his study; but I observed
him nodding significantly to the Irish student, perhaps as much
as to say, &ldquo;Your friend loses no opportunity of propagating
his book;&rdquo; for he was well aware who I was.&nbsp; I shall
not speedily forget the truly good presbyter, Antonio Garcia de
Aguilar, <i>cura</i> of Pitiegua.</p>
<p>We reached Pedroso shortly before nightfall.&nbsp; It was a
small village, containing about thirty houses, and intersected by
a rivulet, or, as it is called, a <i>regata</i>.&nbsp; On its
banks women and maidens were washing their linen, and singing
couplets; the church stood alone and solitary on the farther
side.&nbsp; We inquired for the <i>posada</i>, and were shown a
cottage, differing nothing from the rest in general
appearance.&nbsp; We called at the door in vain, as it is not the
custom of Castile for the people of these halting-places to go <a
name="page1_287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>out to
welcome their visitors: at last we dismounted and entered the
house, demanding of a sullen-looking woman where we were to place
the horses.&nbsp; She said there was a stable within the house,
but we could not put the animals there, as it contained <i>malos
machos</i> <a name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a> belonging to two travellers, who would
certainly fight with our horses, and then there would be a
<i>funcion</i>, which would tear the house down.&nbsp; She then
pointed to an out-house across the way, saying that we could
stable them there.&nbsp; We entered this place, which we found
full of filth and swine, with a door without a lock.&nbsp; I
thought of the fate of the <i>cura&rsquo;s</i> mule, and was
unwilling to trust the horses in such a place, abandoning them to
the mercy of any robber in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I therefore
entered the house, and said resolutely that I was determined to
place them in the stable.&nbsp; Two men were squatted on the
ground, with an immense bowl of stewed hare before them, on which
they were supping; these were the travelling merchants, the
masters of the mules.&nbsp; I passed on to the stable, one of the
men saying softly, &ldquo;Yes, yes, go in and see what will
befall.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had no sooner entered the stable than I
heard a horrid discordant cry, something between a bray and a
yell, and the largest of the <i>machos</i>, tearing his head from
the manger to which he was fastened, his eyes shooting flames,
and breathing a Whirlwind from his nostrils, flung himself on my
stallion.&nbsp; The horse, as savage as himself, reared on his
hind legs, and, after the fashion of an English pugilist, repaid
the other with a pat on the forehead, which nearly felled
him.&nbsp; A combat instantly ensued, and I thought that the
words of the sullen woman would be verified by the house being
torn to pieces.&nbsp; <a name="page1_288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>It ended by my seizing the mule by
the halter, at the risk of my limbs, and hanging upon him with
all my weight, whilst Antonio, with much difficulty, removed the
horse.&nbsp; The man who had been standing at the entrance now
came forward, saying, &ldquo;This would not have happened if you
had taken good advice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon my stating to him the
unreasonableness of expecting that I would risk horses in a place
where they would probably be stolen before the morning, he
replied, &ldquo;True, true, you have perhaps done
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then re-fastened his <i>macho</i>, adding
for additional security a piece of whipcord, which he said
rendered escape impossible.</p>
<p>After supper, I roamed about the village.&nbsp; I addressed
two or three labourers whom I found standing at their doors; they
appeared, however, exceedingly reserved, and with a gruff
&ldquo;<i>buenas noches</i>&rdquo; turned into their houses
without inviting me to enter.&nbsp; I at last found my way to the
church porch, where I continued some time in meditation.&nbsp; At
last I bethought myself of retiring to rest; before departing,
however, I took out and affixed to the porch of the church an
advertisement to the effect that the New Testament was to be
purchased at Salamanca.&nbsp; On returning to the house, I found
the two travelling merchants enjoying profound slumber on various
<i>mantas</i>, or mule-cloths, stretched on the floor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are a French merchant, I suppose,
<i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; said a man, who it seemed was the master
of the house, and whom I had not before seen.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are a French merchant, I suppose, and are on the way to the fair
of Medina.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am neither Frenchman nor
merchant,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and, though I purpose passing
through Medina, it is not with the view of attending the
fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you <a name="page1_289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>are one of the Irish Christians from
Salamanca, <i>Caballero</i>,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I hear
you come from that town.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you call them
<i>Irish Christians</i>?&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are there
pagans in their country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We call them
Christians,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;to distinguish them from
the Irish English, who are worse than pagans, who are Jews and
heretics.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made no answer, but passed on to the
room which had been prepared for me, and from which, the door
being ajar, I heard the following short conversation passing
between the innkeeper and his wife:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Innkeeper</i>.&mdash;<i>Muger</i>, it appears to me that we
have evil guests in the house.</p>
<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;You mean the last comers, the
<i>Caballero</i> and his servant.&nbsp; Yes, I never saw worse
countenances in my life.</p>
<p><i>Innkeeper</i>.&mdash;I do not like the servant, and still
less the master.&nbsp; He has neither formality nor politeness:
he tells me that he is not French, and when I spoke to him of the
Irish Christians, he did not seem to belong to them.&nbsp; I more
than suspect that he is a heretic, or a Jew at least.</p>
<p><i>Wife</i>.&mdash;Perhaps they are both.&nbsp; <i>Maria
Sant&iacute;sima</i>! what shall we do to purify the house when
they are gone?</p>
<p><i>Innkeeper</i>.&mdash;Oh, as for that matter, we must of
course charge it in the <i>cuenta</i>.</p>
<p>I slept soundly, and rather late in the morning arose and
breakfasted, and paid the bill, in which, by its extravagance, I
found the purification had not been forgotten.&nbsp; The
travelling merchants had departed at daybreak.&nbsp; We now led
forth the horses, and mounted; there were several people at the
door staring at us.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the meaning of
this?&rdquo; said I to Antonio.</p>
<p><a name="page1_290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;It is whispered that we are no
Christians,&rdquo; said Antonio; &ldquo;they have come to cross
themselves at our departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In effect, the moment that we rode forward a dozen hands at
least were busied in this evil-averting ceremony.&nbsp; Antonio
instantly turned and crossed himself in the Greek
fashion&mdash;much more complex and difficult than the
Catholic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mirad que Santiguo</i>! <i>que Santiguo de los
demonios</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation290"></a><a
href="#footnote290" class="citation">[290]</a> exclaimed many
voices, whilst for fear of consequences we hastened away.</p>
<p>The day was exceedingly hot, and we wended our way slowly
along the plains of Old Castile.&nbsp; With all that pertains to
Spain, vastness and sublimity are associated: grand are its
mountains, and no less grand are its plains, which seem of
boundless extent, but which are not tame unbroken flats, like the
steppes of Russia.&nbsp; Rough and uneven ground is continually
occurring: here a deep ravine and gully worn by the wintry
torrent; yonder an eminence not unfrequently craggy and savage,
at whose top appears the lone solitary village.&nbsp; There is
little that is blithesome and cheerful, but much that is
melancholy.&nbsp; A few solitary rustics are occasionally seen
toiling in the fields&mdash;fields without limit or boundary,
where the green oak, the elm, or the ash are unknown; where only
the sad and desolate pine displays its pyramid-like form, and
where no grass is to be found.&nbsp; And who are the travellers
of these districts?&nbsp; For the most part <i>arrieros</i>, with
their long trains of mules hung with monotonous tinkling
bells.&nbsp; Behold them with their <a name="page1_291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>brown faces, brown dresses, and
broad slouched hats;&mdash;the <i>arrieros</i>, the true lords of
the roads of Spain, and to whom more respect is paid in these
dusty ways than to dukes and <i>condes</i>;&mdash;the
<i>arrieros</i>, sullen, proud, and rarely courteous, whose deep
voices may be sometimes heard at the distance of a mile, either
cheering the sluggish animals, or shortening the dreary way with
savage and dissonant songs.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon we reached Medina del Campo, <a
name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291"
class="citation">[291]</a> formerly one of the principal cities
of Spain, though at present an inconsiderable place.&nbsp;
Immense ruins surround it in every direction, attesting the
former grandeur of this &ldquo;city of the plain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The great square or market-place is a remarkable spot, surrounded
by a heavy massive <i>piazza</i>, over which rise black buildings
of great antiquity.&nbsp; We found the town crowded with people
awaiting the fair, which was to be held in a day or two.&nbsp; We
experienced some difficulty in obtaining admission into the
<i>posada</i>, which was chiefly occupied by Catalans from
Valladolid.&nbsp; These people not only brought with them their
merchandise, but their wives and children.&nbsp; Some of them
appeared to be people of the worst description: there was one in
particular, a burly savage-looking fellow, of about forty, whose
conduct was atrocious; he sat with his wife, or perhaps
concubine, at the door <a name="page1_292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>of a room which opened upon the
court: he was continually venting horrible and obscene oaths,
both in Spanish and Catalan.&nbsp; The woman was remarkably
handsome, but robust, and seemingly as savage as himself; her
conversation likewise was as frightful as his own.&nbsp; Both
seemed to be under the influence of an incomprehensible
fury.&nbsp; At last, upon some observation from the woman, he
started up, and drawing a long knife from his girdle, stabbed at
her naked bosom; she, however, interposed the palm of her hand,
which was much cut.&nbsp; He stood for a moment viewing the blood
trickling upon the ground, whilst she held up her wounded hand;
then, with an astounding oath, he hurried up the court to the
<i>Plaza</i>.&nbsp; I went up to the woman and said, &ldquo;What
is the cause of this?&nbsp; I hope the ruffian has not seriously
injured you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned her countenance upon me with
the glance of a demon, and at last with a sneer of contempt
exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Car&aacute;ls</i>, <i>que es eso</i>? <a
name="citation292"></a><a href="#footnote292"
class="citation">[292]</a>&nbsp; Cannot a Catalan gentleman be
conversing with his lady upon their own private affairs without
being interrupted by you?&rdquo;&nbsp; She then bound up her hand
with a handkerchief, and going into the room brought a small
table to the door, on which she placed several things, as if for
the evening&rsquo;s repast, and then sat down on a stool.&nbsp;
Presently returned the Catalan, and without a word took his seat
on the threshold; then, as if nothing had occurred, the
extraordinary couple commenced eating and drinking, interlarding
their meal with oaths and jests.</p>
<p>We spent the night at Medina, and departing early next
morning, passed through much the same country as the day before,
until about noon we reached a small <a name="page1_293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span><i>venta</i>, distant half a league
from the Duero; <a name="citation293a"></a><a
href="#footnote293a" class="citation">[293a]</a> here we reposed
ourselves during the heat of the day, and then, remounting,
crossed the river by a handsome stone bridge, and directed our
course to Valladolid.&nbsp; The banks of the Duero in this place
have much beauty: they abound with trees and brushwood, amongst
which, as we passed along, various birds were singing
melodiously.&nbsp; A delicious coolness proceeded from the water,
which in some parts brawled over stones or rippled fleetly over
white sand, and in others glided softly over blue pools of
considerable depth.&nbsp; By the side of one of these last sat a
woman of about thirty, neatly dressed as a peasant; she was
gazing upon the water, into which she occasionally flung flowers
and twigs of trees.&nbsp; I stopped for a moment to ask a
question; she, however, neither looked up nor answered, but
continued gazing at the water as if lost to consciousness of all
beside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that woman?&rdquo; said I to a
shepherd, whom I met the moment after.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is mad,
<i>la pobrecita</i>,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;she lost her child
about a month ago in that pool, and she has been mad ever
since.&nbsp; They are going to send her to Valladolid, to the
<i>Casa de los Locos</i>. <a name="citation293b"></a><a
href="#footnote293b" class="citation">[293b]</a>&nbsp; There are
many who perish every year in the eddies of the Duero; it is a
bad river; <i>vaya usted con la Virgen</i>,
<i>Caballero</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation293c"></a><a
href="#footnote293c" class="citation">[293c]</a>&nbsp; So I rode
on through the <i>pinares</i>, or thin scanty pine forests, which
skirt the way to Valladolid <a name="citation293d"></a><a
href="#footnote293d" class="citation">[293d]</a> in this
direction.</p>
<p><a name="page1_294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>Valladolid is seated in the midst of an immense valley,
or rather hollow, which seems to have been scooped by some mighty
convulsion out of the plain ground of Castile.&nbsp; The
eminences which appear in the neighbourhood are not properly high
grounds, but are rather the sides of this hollow.&nbsp; They are
jagged and precipitous, and exhibit a strange and uncouth
appearance.&nbsp; Volcanic force seems at some distant period to
have been busy in these districts.&nbsp; Valladolid abounds with
convents, at present deserted, which afford some of the finest
specimens of architecture in Spain.&nbsp; The principal church,
though rather ancient, is unfinished: it was intended to be a
building of vast size, but the means of the founders were
insufficient to carry out their plan.&nbsp; It is built of rough
granite.&nbsp; Valladolid is a manufacturing town, but the
commerce is chiefly in the hands of the Catalans, of whom there
is a colony of nearly three hundred established here.&nbsp; It
possesses a beautiful <i>alameda</i>, or public walk, through
which flows the river Escueva.&nbsp; The population is said to
amount to sixty thousand souls.</p>
<p>We put up at the Posada de las Diligencias, a very magnificent
edifice.&nbsp; This <i>posada</i>, however, we were glad to quit
on the second day after our arrival, the accommodation being of
the most wretched description, and the incivility of the people
great; the master of the house, an immense tall fellow, with huge
moustaches and an assumed military air, being far too high a
cavalier to attend to the wants of his guests, with whom, it is
true, he did not appear to be overburdened, as I saw no one but
Antonio and myself.&nbsp; <a name="page1_295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>He was a leading man amongst the
national guards of Valladolid, and delighted in parading about
the city on a clumsy steed, which he kept in a subterranean
stable.</p>
<p>Our next quarters were at the Trojan Horse, an ancient
<i>posada</i>, kept by a native of the Basque provinces, who at
least was not above his business.&nbsp; We found everything in
confusion at Valladolid, a visit from the factious being speedily
expected.&nbsp; All the gates were blockaded, and various forts
had been built to cover the approaches to the city.&nbsp; Shortly
after our departure the Carlists actually did arrive, under the
command of the Biscayan chief, Zariategui. <a
name="citation295"></a><a href="#footnote295"
class="citation">[295]</a>&nbsp; They experienced no opposition,
the staunchest nationals retiring to the principal fort, which
they, however, speedily surrendered, not a gun being fired
throughout the affair.&nbsp; As for my friend the hero of the
inn, on the first rumour of the approach of the enemy, he mounted
his horse and rode off, and was never subsequently heard
of.&nbsp; On our return to Valladolid, we found the inn in other
and better hands, those of a Frenchman from Bayonne, from whom we
received as much civility as we had experienced rudeness from his
predecessor.</p>
<p>In a few days I formed the acquaintance of the bookseller of
the place, a kind-hearted, simple man, who willingly undertook
the charge of vending the Testaments which I brought.</p>
<p>I found literature of every description at the lowest ebb at
Valladolid.&nbsp; My newly acquired friend merely carried on
bookselling in connection with other business; it being, as he
assured me, in itself quite <a name="page1_296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>insufficient to afford him a
livelihood.&nbsp; During the week, however, that I continued in
this city, a considerable number of copies were disposed of, and
a fair prospect opened that many more would be demanded.&nbsp; To
call attention to my books, I had recourse to the same plan which
I had adopted at Salamanca, the affixing of advertisements to the
walls.&nbsp; Before leaving the city I gave orders that these
should be renewed every week; from pursuing which course I
expected that much and manifold good would accrue, as the people
would have continual opportunities of learning that a book which
contains the living word was in existence, and within their
reach, which might induce them to secure it, and consult it even
unto salvation. . . .</p>
<p>In Valladolid I found both an English <a
name="citation296a"></a><a href="#footnote296a"
class="citation">[296a]</a> and Scotch <a
name="citation296b"></a><a href="#footnote296b"
class="citation">[296b]</a> College.&nbsp; From my obliging
friends, the Irish at Salamanca, I bore a letter of introduction
to the rector of the latter.&nbsp; I found this college an old
gloomy edifice, situated in a retired street.&nbsp; The rector
was dressed in the habiliments of a Spanish ecclesiastic, a
character which he was evidently ambitious of assuming.&nbsp;
There was something dry and cold in his manner, and nothing of
that generous warmth and eager hospitality which had so
captivated me in the fine Irish rector of Salamanca; he was,
however, civil and polite, and offered to show me the curiosities
of the place.&nbsp; He evidently knew who I was, and on that
account was, perhaps, more reserved than he otherwise would have
been: not a word passed between us on <a
name="page1_297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>religious
matters, which we seemed to avoid by common consent.&nbsp; Under
the auspices of this gentleman, I visited the college of the
Philippine Missions, which stands beyond the gate of the city,
where I was introduced to the superior, a fine old man of
seventy, very stout, in the habiliments of a friar.&nbsp; There
was an air of placid benignity on his countenance which highly
interested me; his words were few and simple, and he seemed to
have bid adieu to all worldly passions.&nbsp; One little weakness
was, however, still clinging to him.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;This is a noble edifice in which you
dwell, father; I should think it would contain at least two
hundred students.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;More, my son: it is intended for more
hundreds than it now contains single individuals.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I observe that some rude attempts have
been made to fortify it; the walls are pierced with loopholes in
every direction.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;The nationals of Valladolid visited us a
few days ago, and committed much useless damage; they were rather
rude, and threatened me with their clubs.&nbsp; Poor men, poor
men!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I suppose that even these missions, which
are certainly intended for a noble end, experience the sad
effects of the present convulsed state of Spain?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;But too true: we at present receive no
assistance from the government, and are left to the Lord and
ourselves.</p>
<p><i>Myself.</i>&mdash;How many aspirants for the mission are
you at present instructing?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;Not one, my son; not one.&nbsp; They are
all fled.&nbsp; The flock is scattered, and the shepherd left
alone.</p>
<p><a name="page1_298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Your reverence has doubtless taken
an active part in the mission abroad?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;I was forty years in the Philippines, my
son, forty years amongst the Indians.&nbsp; Ah me! how I love
those Indians of the Philippines!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Can your reverence discourse in the
language of the Indians?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;No, my son.&nbsp; We teach the Indians
Castilian.&nbsp; There is no better language, I believe.&nbsp; We
teach them Castilian, and the adoration of the Virgin.&nbsp; What
more need they know?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And what did your reverence think of the
Philippines as a country?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;I was forty years in the Philippines, but
I know little of the country.&nbsp; I do not like the
country.&nbsp; I love the Indians.&nbsp; The country is not very
bad; it is, however, not worth Castile.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Is your reverence a Castilian?</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&mdash;I am an <i>Old</i> Castilian, my son. <a
name="citation298"></a><a href="#footnote298"
class="citation">[298]</a></p>
<p>From the house of the Philippine Missions my friend conducted
me to the English College: this establishment seemed in every
respect to be on a more magnificent scale than its Scottish
sister.&nbsp; In the latter there were few pupils, scarcely six
or seven, I believe, whilst in the English seminary I was
informed that between thirty and forty were receiving their
education.&nbsp; It is a beautiful building, with a small but
splendid church, and a handsome library.&nbsp; The situation is
light and airy: it stands by itself in an unfrequented part of
the city, and, with genuine English exclusiveness, is surrounded
by a high wall, which <a name="page1_299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>incloses a delicious garden.&nbsp;
This is by far the most remarkable establishment of the kind in
the Peninsula, and I believe the most prosperous.&nbsp; From the
cursory view which I enjoyed of its interior, I of course cannot
be expected to know much of its economy.&nbsp; I could not,
however, fail to be struck with the order, neatness, and system
which pervaded it.&nbsp; There was, however, an air of severe
monastic discipline, though I am far from asserting that such
actually existed.&nbsp; We were attended throughout by the
sub-rector, the principal being absent.&nbsp; Of all the
curiosities of this college, the most remarkable is the
picture-gallery, which contains neither more nor less than the
portraits of a variety of scholars of this house who eventually
suffered martyrdom in England, in the exercise of their vocation
in the angry times of the Sixth Edward and fierce
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Yes, in this very house were many of those pale,
smiling, half-foreign priests educated, who, like stealthy
grimalkins, traversed green England in all directions; crept into
old halls beneath umbrageous rookeries, fanning the dying embers
of Popery, with no other hope nor perhaps wish than to perish
disembowelled by the bloody hands of the executioner, amongst the
yells of a rabble as bigoted as themselves; priests like
Bedingfield and Garnet, <a name="citation299"></a><a
href="#footnote299" class="citation">[299]</a> and many others
who have left a name in English story.&nbsp; Doubtless many a
history, only the more wonderful for being true, could be wrought
out of the archives of the English Popish seminary at
Valladolid.</p>
<p>There was no lack of guests at the Trojan Horse, where we had
taken up our abode at Valladolid.&nbsp; Amongst others who
arrived during my sojourn was a robust buxom dame, exceedingly
well dressed in <a name="page1_300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>black silk, with a costly <i>mantilla</i>.&nbsp; She
was accompanied by a very handsome, but sullen and
malicious-looking urchin of about fifteen, who appeared to be her
son.&nbsp; She came from Toro, a place about a day&rsquo;s
journey from Valladolid, and celebrated for its wine. <a
name="citation300a"></a><a href="#footnote300a"
class="citation">[300a]</a>&nbsp; One night, as we were seated in
the court of the inn enjoying the <i>fresco</i>, the following
conversation ensued between us.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;<i>Vaya</i>, <i>vaya</i>, what a tiresome
place is Valladolid!&nbsp; How different from Toro!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I should have thought that it is at least
as agreeable as Toro, which is not a third part so large.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;As agreeable as Toro!&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>,
<i>vaya</i>!&nbsp; Were you ever in the prison of Toro, Sir
Cavalier?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I have never had that honour; the prison
is generally the last place which I think of visiting.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;See the difference of tastes: I have been
to see the prison of Valladolid, and it seems as tiresome as the
town.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Of course, if grief and tediousness exist
anywhere, you will find them in the prison.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;Not in that of Toro.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What does that of Toro possess to
distinguish it from all others?</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;What does it possess?&nbsp;
<i>Vaya</i>!&nbsp; Am I not the <i>carcelera</i>?&nbsp; Is not my
husband the <i>alcayde</i>? <a name="citation300b"></a><a
href="#footnote300b" class="citation">[300b]</a>&nbsp; Is not
that son of mine a child of the prison?</p>
<p><a name="page1_301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I beg your pardon, I was not aware
of that circumstance; it of course makes much difference.</p>
<p><i>Lady</i>.&mdash;I believe you.&nbsp; I am a daughter of
that prison: my father was <i>alcayde</i>, and my son might hope
to be so, were he not a fool.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;His countenance, then, belies him
strangely.&nbsp; I should be loth to purchase that youngster for
a fool.</p>
<p><i>Gaoleress</i>.&mdash;You would have a fine bargain if you
did: he has more <i>picardias</i> than any <i>calabozero</i> in
Toro.&nbsp; What I mean is, that he does not take to the prison
as he ought to do, considering what his fathers were before
him.&nbsp; He has too much pride&mdash;too many fancies; and he
has at length persuaded me to bring him to Valladolid, where I
have arranged with a merchant who lives in the <i>Plaza</i> to
take him on trial.&nbsp; I wish he may not find his way to the
prison: if he do, he will find that being a prisoner is a very
different thing from being a son of the prison.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;As there is so much merriment at Toro,
you of course attend to the comfort of your prisoners.</p>
<p><i>Gaoleress</i>.&mdash;Yes, we are very kind to them&mdash;I
mean to those who are <i>caballeros</i>; but as for those with
vermin and <i>miseria</i>, what can we do?&nbsp; It is a merry
prison that of Toro; we allow as much wine to enter as the
prisoners can purchase and pay duty for.&nbsp; This of Valladolid
is not half so gay: there is no prison like Toro.&nbsp; I learned
there to play on the guitar.&nbsp; An Andalusian cavalier taught
me to touch the guitar and to sing <i>&agrave; la
Gitana</i>.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he was my first
<i>novio</i>.&nbsp; Juanito, bring me the guitar, that I may play
this gentleman a tune of Andalusia.</p>
<p>The <i>carcelera</i> had a fine voice, and touched the
favourite instrument of the Spaniards in a truly masterly
manner.&nbsp; I remained listening to her performance <a
name="page1_302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>for
nearly an hour, when I retired to my apartment and my
repose.&nbsp; I believe that she continued playing and singing
during the greater part of the night, for as I occasionally awoke
I could still hear her; and even in my slumbers the strings were
ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>After a sojourn of about ten days at Valladolid, we directed
our course towards Leon.&nbsp; We arrived about noon at
Due&ntilde;as, <a name="citation303"></a><a href="#footnote303"
class="citation">[303]</a> a town at the distance of six short
leagues from Valladolid.&nbsp; It is in every respect a singular
place: it stands on a rising ground, and directly above it towers
a steep conical mountain of calcareous earth, crowned by a ruined
castle.&nbsp; Around Due&ntilde;as are seen a multitude of caves
scooped in the high banks and secured with strong doors.&nbsp;
These are cellars, in which is deposited the wine, of which
abundance is grown in the neighbourhood, and which is chiefly
sold to the Navarrese and the mountaineers of Santander, who
arrive in cars drawn by oxen, and convey it away in large
quantities.&nbsp; We put up at a mean posada in the suburb for
the purpose of refreshing our horses.&nbsp; Several cavalry
soldiers were quartered there, who instantly came forth, and
began, with the eyes of connoisseurs, to inspect my Andalusian
<i>entero</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;A capital horse that would be for our
troop,&rdquo; said <a name="page1_304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>the corporal; &ldquo;what a chest he
has!&nbsp; By what right do you travel with that horse,
<i>se&ntilde;or</i>, when so many are wanted for the
queen&rsquo;s service?&nbsp; He belongs to the
<i>requiso</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation304a"></a><a
href="#footnote304a" class="citation">[304a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I
travel with him by right of purchase, and being an
Englishman,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, your worship is an
Englishman,&rdquo; answered the corporal; &ldquo;that, indeed,
alters the matter.&nbsp; The English in Spain are allowed to do
what they please with their own, which is more than the Spaniards
are.&nbsp; Cavalier, I have seen your countrymen <a
name="citation304b"></a><a href="#footnote304b"
class="citation">[304b]</a> in the Basque provinces; <i>vaya</i>,
what riders! what horses!&nbsp; They do not fight badly
either.&nbsp; But their chief skill is in riding: I have seen
them dash over <i>barrancos</i> to get at the factious, who
thought themselves quite secure, and then they would fall upon
them on a sudden and kill them to a man.&nbsp; In truth, your
worship, this is a fine horse; I must look at his
teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the corporal&mdash;his nose and eyes were in the
horse&rsquo;s mouth: the rest of the party, who might amount to
six or seven, were not less busily engaged.&nbsp; One was
examining his fore feet, another his hind; one fellow was pulling
at his tail with all his might, while another pinched the
windpipe, for the purpose of discovering whether the animal was
at all touched there.&nbsp; At last, perceiving that the corporal
was about to remove the saddle, that he might examine the back of
the animal, I exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, ye <i>chab&eacute;s</i> of Egypt, ye forget that
ye are <i>hundunares</i>, <a name="citation304c"></a><a
href="#footnote304c" class="citation">[304c]</a> and are no
longer <i>paruguing grastes</i> in the
<i>chard&iacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>The
corporal at these words turned his face full upon me, and so did
all the rest.&nbsp; Yes, sure enough, there were the countenances
of Egypt, and the fixed filmy stare of eye.&nbsp; We continued
looking at each other for a minute at least, when the corporal, a
villanous-looking fellow, at last said, in the richest gypsy
whine imaginable, &ldquo;The <i>erray</i> knows us, the poor
<i>Calor&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; And he an Englishman!&nbsp;
<i>Bullati</i>!&nbsp; I should not have thought that there was
e&rsquo;er a <i>Busn&oacute;</i> would know us in these parts,
where <i>Gitanos</i> are never seen.&nbsp; Yes, your worship is
right; we are all here of the blood of the
<i>Calor&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; We are from <i>Melegrana</i>, your
worship; they took us from thence and sent us to the wars.&nbsp;
Your worship is right; the sight of that horse made us believe we
were at home again in the <i>mercado</i> of Granada; he is a
countryman of ours, a real <i>Andalou</i>.&nbsp; <i>Por dios</i>,
your worship, sell us that horse; we are poor
<i>Calor&eacute;</i>, but we can buy him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that you are soldiers,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How should you buy my horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are soldiers, your worship,&rdquo; said the
corporal, &ldquo;but we are still <i>Calor&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; We
buy and sell <i>bestis</i>; the captain of our troop is in league
with us.&nbsp; We have been to the wars, but not to fight; we
left that to the <i>Busn&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; We have kept
together, and, like true <i>Calor&eacute;</i>, have stood back to
back.&nbsp; We have made money in the wars, your worship.&nbsp;
<i>No tenga usted cuidao</i>. <a name="citation305a"></a><a
href="#footnote305a" class="citation">[305a]</a>&nbsp; We can buy
your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he pulled out a purse, which contained at least ten
<i>ounces</i> <a name="citation305b"></a><a href="#footnote305b"
class="citation">[305b]</a> of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were willing to sell,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;what would you give me for that horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your worship wishes to sell your horse&mdash;that
<a name="page1_306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>alters
the matter.&nbsp; We will give ten dollars for your
worship&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; He is good for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You this
moment told me he was a fine horse&mdash;an Andalusian, and a
countryman of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>! we did not say that he was an
<i>Andalou</i>.&nbsp; We said he was an <i>Estremou</i>, and the
worst of his kind.&nbsp; He is eighteen years old, your worship,
short-winded and galled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to sell my horse,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;quite the contrary.&nbsp; I had rather buy than
sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your worship does not wish to sell your horse,&rdquo;
said the gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay, your worship; we will give
sixty dollars for your worship&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not sell him for two hundred and sixty.&nbsp;
<i>Meclis</i>! <i>Meclis</i>! say no more.&nbsp; I know your
gypsy tricks.&nbsp; I will have no dealings with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not hear your worship say that you wished to buy
a horse?&rdquo; said the gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to buy a horse,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if
I need anything it is a pony to carry our baggage.&nbsp; But it
is getting late.&nbsp; Antonio, pay the reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, your worship, do not be in a hurry,&rdquo; said
the gypsy; &ldquo;I have got the very pony which will suit
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for my answer, he hurried into the stable,
from whence he presently returned, leading an animal by a
halter.&nbsp; It was a pony of about thirteen hands high, of a
dark red colour; it was very much galled all over, the marks of
ropes and thongs being visible on its hide.&nbsp; The figure,
however, was good, and there was an extraordinary brightness in
its eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, your worship,&rdquo; said the gypsy;
&ldquo;there is the best pony in all Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>&ldquo;What do you mean by showing me this wretched
creature?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wretched creature,&rdquo; said the gypsy,
&ldquo;is a better horse than your <i>Andalou</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would not exchange,&rdquo; said I,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, what I say is, that he shall run
with your <i>Andalou</i>, and beat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks feeble,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;his work is
well-nigh done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeble as he is, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, you could not
manage him; no, nor any Englishman in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the creature again, and was still more struck with
its figure.&nbsp; I was in need of a pony to relieve occasionally
the horse of Antonio in carrying the baggage which we had brought
from Madrid, and though the condition of this was wretched, I
thought that by kind treatment I might possibly soon bring him
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I mount this animal?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a baggage pony, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, and is ill
to mount.&nbsp; He will suffer none but myself to mount him, who
am his master.&nbsp; When he once commences running, nothing will
stop him but the sea.&nbsp; He springs over hills and mountains,
and leaves them behind in a moment.&nbsp; If you will mount him,
<i>se&ntilde;or</i>, suffer me to fetch a bridle, for you can
never hold him in with the halter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nonsense,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
pretend that he is spirited in order to enhance the price.&nbsp;
I tell you his work is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the halter in my hand and mounted.&nbsp; I was no
sooner on his back than the creature, who had before stood stone
still, without displaying the slightest inclination to move, and
who in fact gave no farther <a name="page1_308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>indication of existence than
occasionally rolling his eyes and pricking up an ear, sprang
forward like a racehorse, at a most desperate gallop.&nbsp; I had
expected that he might kick or fling himself down on the ground,
in order to get rid of his burden, but for this escapade I was
quite unprepared.&nbsp; I had no difficulty, however, in keeping
on his back, having been accustomed from my childhood to ride
without a saddle.&nbsp; To stop him, however, baffled all my
endeavours, and I almost began to pay credit to the words of the
gypsy, who had said that he would run on until he reached the
sea.&nbsp; I had, however, a strong arm, and I tugged at the
halter until I compelled him to turn slightly his neck, which
from its stiffness might almost have been of wood; he, however,
did not abate his speed for a moment.&nbsp; On the left side of
the road down which he was dashing was a deep trench, just where
the road took a turn towards the right, and over this he sprang
in a sideward direction.&nbsp; The halter broke with the effort;
the pony shot forward like an arrow, whilst I fell back into the
dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; said the gypsy, coming up
with the most serious countenance in the world, &ldquo;I told you
not to mount that animal unless well bridled and bitted.&nbsp; He
is a baggage pony, and will suffer none to mount his back, with
the exception of myself who feed him.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here he
whistled, and the animal, who was scurring over the field, and
occasionally kicking up his heels, instantly returned with a
gentle neigh.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, your worship, see how gentle he
is.&nbsp; He is a capital baggage pony, and will carry all you
have over the hills of Galicia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you ask for him?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, as your worship is an Englishman,
and a <a name="page1_309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>good <i>ginete</i>, and, moreover, understands the ways
of the <i>Calor&eacute;</i>, and their tricks and their language
also, I will sell him to you a bargain.&nbsp; I will take two
hundred and sixty dollars for him, and no less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a large sum,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, not at all, considering that
he is a baggage pony, and belongs to the troop, and is not mine
to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours&rsquo; ride brought us to Palencia, <a
name="citation309a"></a><a href="#footnote309a"
class="citation">[309a]</a> a fine old town, beautifully situated
on the Carrion, and famous for its trade in wool.&nbsp; We put up
at the best <i>posada</i> which the place afforded, and I
forthwith proceeded to visit one of the principal merchants of
the town, to whom I was recommended by my banker in Madrid.&nbsp;
I was told, however, that he was taking his <i>siesta</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I had better take my own,&rdquo; said I, and returned
to the <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; In the evening I went again, when I
saw him.&nbsp; He was a short bulky man, about thirty, and
received me at first with some degree of bluntness; his manner,
however, presently became more kind, and at last he scarcely
appeared to know how to show me sufficient civility.&nbsp; His
brother had just arrived from Santander, and to him he introduced
me.&nbsp; This last was a highly intelligent person, and had
passed many years of his life in England.&nbsp; They both
insisted upon showing me the town, and, indeed, led me all over
it, and about the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I particularly admired the
cathedral, a light, elegant, but ancient Gothic edifice. <a
name="citation309b"></a><a href="#footnote309b"
class="citation">[309b]</a>&nbsp; Whilst we walked about <a
name="page1_310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>the
aisles, the evening sun, pouring its mellow rays through the
arched windows, illumined some beautiful paintings of Murillo, <a
name="citation310a"></a><a href="#footnote310a"
class="citation">[310a]</a> with which the sacred edifice is
adorned.&nbsp; From the church my friends conducted me to a
fulling mill in the neighbourhood, by a picturesque walk.&nbsp;
There was no lack either of trees or water, and I remarked, that
the environs of Palencia were amongst the most pleasant places
that I had ever seen.</p>
<p>Tired at last with rambling, we repaired to a coffee-house,
where they regaled me with chocolate and sweetmeats.&nbsp; Such
was their hospitality; and of hospitality of this simple and
agreeable kind there is much in Spain.</p>
<p>On the next day we pursued our journey, a dreary one, for the
most part, over bleak and barren plains, interspersed with silent
and cheerless towns and villages, which stood at the distance of
two or three leagues from each other.&nbsp; About midday we
obtained a dim and distant view of an immense range of mountains,
<a name="citation310b"></a><a href="#footnote310b"
class="citation">[310b]</a> which are in fact those which bound
Castile on the north.&nbsp; The day, however, became dim and
obscure, and we speedily lost sight of them.&nbsp; A hollow wind
now arose and blew over these desolate plains with violence,
wafting clouds of dust into our faces; the rays of the sun were
few, and those red and angry.&nbsp; I was tired of my journey,
and when about four we <a name="page1_311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>reached ---, <a
name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a> a large village, halfway between
Palencia and Leon, I declared my intention of stopping for the
night.&nbsp; I scarcely ever saw a more desolate place than this
same town or village of ---.&nbsp; The houses were for the most
part large, but the walls were of mud, like those of barns.&nbsp;
We saw no person in the long winding street to direct us to the
<i>venta</i>, or <i>posada</i>, till at last, at the farther end
of the place, we descried two black figures standing at a door,
of whom, on making inquiry, we learned that the door at which
they stood was that of the house we were in quest of.&nbsp; There
was something strange in the appearance of these two beings, who
seemed the genii of the place.&nbsp; One was a small slim man,
about fifty, with sharp ill-natured features.&nbsp; He was
dressed in coarse black worsted stockings, black breeches, and an
ample black coat with long trailing skirts.&nbsp; I should at
once have taken him for an ecclesiastic, but for his hat, which
had nothing clerical about it, being a pinched diminutive
beaver.&nbsp; His companion was of low stature, and a much
younger man.&nbsp; He was dressed in similar fashion, save that
he wore a dark blue cloak.&nbsp; Both carried walking-sticks in
their hands, and kept hovering about the door, now within and now
without, occasionally looking up the road, as if they expected
some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio
to me, in French, &ldquo;those two fellows are Carlist priests,
and are awaiting the arrival of the Pretender.&nbsp; <i>Les
imbeciles</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>We
conducted our horses to the stable, to which we were shown by the
woman of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are those men?&rdquo; said I
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eldest is head curate to our <i>pueblo</i>,&rdquo;
said she; &ldquo;the other is brother to my husband.&nbsp;
<i>Pobrecito</i>! he was a friar in our convent before it was
shut up and the brethren driven forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We returned to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose,
gentlemen,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;that you are
Catalans?&nbsp; Do you bring any news from that
kingdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose we are Catalans?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I heard you this moment conversing in that
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bring no news from Catalonia,&rdquo; <a
name="citation312"></a><a href="#footnote312"
class="citation">[312]</a> said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,
however, that the greater part of that principality is in the
hands of the Carlists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem, brother Pedro!&nbsp; This gentleman says that the
greater part of Catalonia is in the hands of the royalists.&nbsp;
Pray, sir, where may Don Carlos be at present with his
army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be coming down the road this moment,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;for what I know;&rdquo; and, stepping out, I looked up
the way.</p>
<p>The two figures were at my side in a moment.&nbsp; Antonio
followed, and we all four looked intently up the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; said I at last to
Antonia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Non, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything, sir?&rdquo; said I to the
curate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing,&rdquo; said the curate, stretching out
his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing,&rdquo; said Pedro, the ex-friar;
&ldquo;I see <a name="page1_313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>nothing but the dust, which is becoming every moment
more blinding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go in, then,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed, it is scarcely prudent to be standing here looking
out for the Pretender; should the nationals of the town hear of
it, they might perhaps shoot us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said the curate, following me;
&ldquo;there are no nationals in this place: I would fain see
what inhabitant would dare become a national.&nbsp; When the
inhabitants of this place were ordered to take up arms as
nationals, they refused to a man, and on that account we had to
pay a mulct; therefore, friend, you may speak out if you have
anything to communicate; we are all of your opinion
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am of no opinion at all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;save
that I want my supper.&nbsp; I am neither for <i>Rey</i> nor
<i>Roque</i>. <a name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313"
class="citation">[313]</a>&nbsp; You say that I am a Catalan, and
you know that Catalans think only of their own
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening I strolled by myself about the village, which I
found still more forlorn and melancholy that it at first
appeared; perhaps, however, it had been a place of consequence in
its time.&nbsp; In one corner of it I found the ruins of a large
clumsy castle, chiefly built of flint stones: into these ruins I
attempted to penetrate, but the entrance was secured by a
gate.&nbsp; From the castle I found my way to the convent, a sad
desolate place, formerly the residence of mendicant brothers of
the order of St. Francis.&nbsp; I was about to return to the inn,
when I heard a loud buzz of voices, and, following the sound,
presently <a name="page1_314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>reached a kind of meadow, where, upon a small knoll,
sat a priest in full canonicals, reading in a loud voice a
newspaper, while around him, either erect or seated on the grass,
were assembled about fifty <i>vecinos</i>, for the most part
dressed in long cloaks, amongst whom I discovered my two friends
the curate and friar.&nbsp; A fine knot of Carlist quidnuncs,
said I to myself, and turned away to another part of the meadow,
where the cattle of the village were grazing.&nbsp; The curate,
on observing me, detached himself instantly from the group, and
followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am told you want a pony,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;there now is mine feeding amongst those horses, the best
in the kingdom of Leon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then began with all the
volubility of a <i>chalan</i> to descant on the points of the
animal.&nbsp; Presently the friar joined us, who, observing his
opportunity, pulled me by the sleeve and whispered, &ldquo;Have
nothing to do with the curate, master; he is the greatest thief
in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; If you want a pony, my brother has a
much better, which he will dispose of cheaper.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall wait till I arrive at Leon,&rdquo; I exclaimed,
and walked away, musing on priestly friendship and sincerity.</p>
<p>From --- to Leon, a distance of eight leagues, the country
rapidly improved: we passed over several small streams, and
occasionally found ourselves amongst meadows in which grass was
growing in the richest luxuriance.&nbsp; The sun shone out
brightly, and I hailed his reappearance with joy, though the heat
of his beams was oppressive.&nbsp; On arriving within two leagues
of Leon, we passed numerous cars and waggons, and bands of people
with horses and mules, all hastening to the celebrated fair which
is held in the city on St. John&rsquo;s or Midsummer day, and
which <a name="page1_315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>took place within three days after our arrival.&nbsp;
This fair, though principally intended for the sale of horses, is
frequented by merchants from many parts of Spain, who attend with
goods of various kinds, and amongst them I remarked many of the
Catalans whom I had previously seen at Medina and Valladolid.</p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable in Leon, <a
name="citation315"></a><a href="#footnote315"
class="citation">[315]</a> which is an old gloomy town, with the
exception of its cathedral, in many respects a counterpart of the
church of Palencia, exhibiting the same light and elegant
architecture, but, unlike its beautiful sister, unadorned with
splendid paintings.&nbsp; The situation of Leon is highly
pleasant, in the midst of a blooming country, abounding with
trees, and watered by many streams, which have their source in
the mighty mountains in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is, however,
by no means a healthy place, especially in summer, when the heats
raise noxious exhalations from the waters, generating many kinds
of disorders, especially fevers.</p>
<p>I had scarcely been at Leon three days when I was seized with
a fever, against which I thought the strength even of my
constitution would have yielded, for it wore me almost to a
skeleton, and when it departed, at the end of about a week, left
me in such a <a name="page1_316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>deplorable state of weakness that I was scarcely able
to make the slightest exertion.&nbsp; I had, however, previously
persuaded a bookseller to undertake the charge of vending the
Testaments, and had published my advertisements as usual, though
without very sanguine hope of success, as Leon is a place where
the inhabitants, with very few exceptions, are furious Carlists,
and ignorant and blinded followers of the old papal church.&nbsp;
It is, moreover, a bishop&rsquo;s see, which was once enjoyed by
the prime counsellor of Don Carlos, whose fierce and bigoted
spirit still seems to pervade the place.&nbsp; Scarcely had the
advertisements appeared, when the clergy were in motion.&nbsp;
They went from house to house, banning and cursing, and
denouncing misery to whomsoever should either purchase or read
&ldquo;the accursed books,&rdquo; which had been sent into the
country by heretics for the purpose of perverting the innocent
minds of the population.&nbsp; They did more; they commenced a
process against the bookseller in the ecclesiastical court.&nbsp;
Fortunately this court is not at present in the possession of
much authority; and the bookseller, a bold and determined man,
set them at defiance, and went so far as to affix an
advertisement to the gate of the very cathedral.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the cry raised against the book, several copies
were sold at Leon: two were purchased by ex-friars, and the same
number by parochial priests from neighbouring villages.&nbsp; I
believe the whole number disposed of during my stay amounted to
fifteen; so that my visit to this dark corner was not altogether
in vain, as the seed of the Gospel has been sown, though
sparingly.&nbsp; But the palpable darkness which envelops Leon is
truly lamentable, and the ignorance of the people is so great,
that printed <a name="page1_317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>charms and incantations against Satan and his host, and
against every kind of misfortune, are publicly sold in the shops,
and are in great demand.&nbsp; Such are the results of Popery, a
delusion which, more than any other, has tended to debase and
brutalize the human mind.</p>
<p>I had scarcely risen from my bed where the fever had cast me,
when I found that Antonio had become alarmed.&nbsp; He informed
me that he had seen several soldiers in the uniform of Don Carlos
lurking at the door of the <i>posada</i>, and that they had been
making inquiries concerning me.</p>
<p>It was indeed a singular fact connected with Leon, that
upwards of fifty of these fellows, who had on various accounts
left the ranks of the Pretender, were walking about the streets
dressed in his livery, and with all the confidence which the
certainty of protection from the local authorities could afford
them should any one be disposed to interrupt them.</p>
<p>I learned moreover from Antonio, that the person in whose
house we were living was a notorious <i>alcahuete</i>, or spy to
the robbers in the neighbourhood, and that unless we took our
departure speedily and unexpectedly, we should to a certainty be
plundered on the road.&nbsp; I did not pay much attention to
these hints, but my desire to quit Leon was great, as I was
convinced that as long as I continued there I should be unable to
regain my health and vigour.</p>
<p>Accordingly, at three in the morning, we departed for
Galicia.&nbsp; We had scarcely proceeded half a league when we
were overtaken by a thunderstorm of tremendous violence.&nbsp; We
were at that time in the midst of a wood which extends to some
distance in the direction in which we were going.&nbsp; The trees
were <a name="page1_318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>bowed almost to the ground by the wind or torn up by
the roots, whilst the earth was ploughed up by the lightning,
which burst all around and nearly blinded us.&nbsp; The spirited
Andalusian on which I rode became furious, and bounded into the
air as if possessed.&nbsp; Owing to my state of weakness, I had
the greatest difficulty in maintaining my seat, and avoiding a
fall which might have been fatal.&nbsp; A tremendous discharge of
rain followed the storm, which swelled the brooks and streams and
flooded the surrounding country, causing much damage amongst the
corn.&nbsp; After riding about five leagues, we began to enter
the mountainous district which surrounds Astorga.&nbsp; The heat
now became almost suffocating; swarms of flies began to make
their appearance, and settling down upon the horses, stung them
almost to madness, whilst the road was very flinty and
trying.&nbsp; It was with great difficulty that we reached
Astorga, <a name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318"
class="citation">[318]</a> covered with mud and dust, our tongues
cleaving to our palates with thirst.</p>
<h2><a name="page1_319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Astorga&mdash;The Inn&mdash;The
Maragatos&mdash;Habits of the Maragatos&mdash;The Statue.</p>
<p>We went to a <i>posada</i> in the suburbs, the only one,
indeed, which the place afforded.&nbsp; The courtyard was full of
<i>arrieros</i> and carriers, brawling loudly; the master of the
house was fighting with two of his customers, and universal
confusion reigned around.&nbsp; As I dismounted I received the
contents of a wine-glass in my face, of which greeting, as it was
probably intended for another, I took no notice.&nbsp; Antonio,
however, was not so patient, for on being struck with a cudgel,
he instantly returned the salute with his whip, scarifying the
countenance of a carman.&nbsp; In my endeavours to separate these
two antagonists, my horse broke loose, and rushing amongst the
promiscuous crowd, overturned several individuals, and committed
no little damage.&nbsp; It was a long time before peace was
restored: at last we were shown to a tolerably decent
chamber.&nbsp; We had, however, no sooner taken possession of it,
than the waggon from Madrid arrived on its way to Corunna, <a
name="citation319"></a><a href="#footnote319"
class="citation">[319]</a> filled with dusty travellers, <a
name="page1_320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>consisting of women, children, invalid officers, and
the like.&nbsp; We were now forthwith dislodged, and our baggage
flung into the yard.&nbsp; On our complaining of this treatment,
we were told that we were two vagabonds whom nobody knew; who had
come without an <i>arriero</i>, and had already set the whole
house in confusion.&nbsp; As a great favour, however, we were at
length permitted to take up our abode in a ruinous building down
the yard, adjoining the stable, and filled with rats and
vermin.&nbsp; Here there was an old bed with a tester, and with
this wretched accommodation we were glad to content ourselves,
for I could proceed no farther, and was burnt with fever.&nbsp;
The heat of the place was intolerable, and I sat on the staircase
with my head between my hands, gasping for breath: soon appeared
Antonio with vinegar and water, which I drank, and felt
relieved.</p>
<p>We continued in this suburb three days, during the greatest
part of which time I was stretched on the tester-bed.&nbsp; I
once or twice contrived to make my way into the town, but found
no bookseller, nor any person willing to undertake the charge of
disposing of my Testaments.&nbsp; The people were brutal, stupid,
and uncivil, and I returned to my tester-bed fatigued and
dispirited.&nbsp; Here I lay listening from time to time to the
sweet chimes which rang from the clock of the old
cathedral.&nbsp; The master of the house never came near me, nor,
indeed, once inquired about me.&nbsp; Beneath the care of
Antonio, however, I speedily waxed stronger.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he to me one evening, &ldquo;I see
you are better; let us quit this bad town and worse <i>posada</i>
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; <i>Allons</i>, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>!&nbsp; <i>Il est temps de nous mettre en chemin
pour Lugo et Galice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>Before proceeding, however, to narrate what befell us
in this journey to Lugo and Galicia, it will, perhaps, not be
amiss to say a few words concerning Astorga and its
vicinity.&nbsp; It is a walled town, containing about five or six
thousand inhabitants, with a cathedral and college, which last
is, however, at present deserted.&nbsp; It is situated on the
confines, and may be called the capital, of a tract of land
called the country of the Maragatos, which occupies about three
square leagues, and has for its north-western boundary a mountain
called Telleno, the loftiest of a chain of hills which have their
origin near the mouth of the river Minho, and are connected with
the immense range which constitutes the frontier of the Asturias
and Guipuzcoa.</p>
<p>The land is ungrateful and barren, and niggardly repays the
toil of the cultivator, being for the most part rocky, with a
slight sprinkling of red brick earth.</p>
<p>The Maragatos <a name="citation321"></a><a href="#footnote321"
class="citation">[321]</a> are perhaps the most singular caste <a
name="page1_322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>to be
found amongst the chequered population of Spain.&nbsp; They have
their own peculiar customs and dress, and never intermarry with
the Spaniards.&nbsp; Their name is a clue to their origin, as it
signifies &ldquo;Moorish Goths,&rdquo; and at the present day
their garb differs but little from that of the Moors of Barbary,
as it consists of a long tight jacket, secured at the waist by a
broad girdle, loose short trousers which terminate at the knee,
and boots and gaiters.&nbsp; Their heads are shaven, a slight
fringe of hair being only left at the lower part.&nbsp; If they
wore the turban, or <i>barret</i>, <a name="citation322"></a><a
href="#footnote322" class="citation">[322]</a> they could
scarcely be distinguished from the Moors in dress; but in lieu
thereof they wear the <i>sombrero</i>, or broad slouching hat of
Spain.&nbsp; There can be little doubt that they are a remnant of
those Goths who sided with the Moors on their invasion of Spain,
and who adopted their religion, customs, and manner of dress,
which, with the exception of the first, are still to a
considerable degree retained by them.&nbsp; It is, however,
evident that their blood has at no time mingled with that of the
wild children of the desert, for scarcely amongst the hills of
Norway would you find figures and faces more essentially Gothic
than those of the Maragatos.&nbsp; They are strong athletic men,
but loutish and heavy, and their features, though for the most
part well formed, are vacant and devoid of expression.&nbsp; They
are slow and plain of speech, and those eloquent <a
name="page1_323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>and
imaginative sallies so common in the conversation of other
Spaniards seldom or never escape them; they have, moreover, a
coarse, thick pronunciation, and when you hear them speak, you
almost imagine that it is some German or English peasant
attempting to express himself in the language of the
Peninsula.&nbsp; They are constitutionally phlegmatic, and it is
very difficult to arouse their anger; but they are dangerous and
desperate when once incensed; and a person who knew them well
told me that he would rather face ten Valencians, people infamous
for their ferocity and blood-thirstiness, than confront one angry
Maragato, sluggish and stupid though he be on other
occasions.</p>
<p>The men scarcely ever occupy themselves in husbandry, which
they abandon to the women, who plough the flinty fields and
gather in the scanty harvests.&nbsp; Their husbands and sons are
far differently employed: for they are a nation of
<i>arrieros</i>, or carriers, and almost esteem it a disgrace to
follow any other profession.&nbsp; On every road of Spain,
particularly those north of the mountains which divide the two
Castiles, may be seen gangs of fives and sixes of these people
lolling or sleeping beneath the broiling sun, on gigantic and
heavily laden mutes and mules. <a name="citation323"></a><a
href="#footnote323" class="citation">[323]</a>&nbsp; In a word,
almost the entire commerce of nearly one-half of Spain passes
through the hands of the Maragatos, whose fidelity to their trust
is such, that no one accustomed to employ them would hesitate to
confide to them the transport of a ton of treasure from the sea
of Biscay to Madrid; knowing well that it would not be their
fault were it not delivered safe and undiminished, <a
name="page1_324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>even of a
grain, and that bold must be the thieves who would seek to wrest
it from the far-feared Maragatos, who would cling to it whilst
they could stand, and would cover it with their bodies when they
fell in the act of loading or discharging their long
carbines.</p>
<p>But they are far from being disinterested, and if they are the
most trustworthy of all the <i>arrieros</i> of Spain, they in
general demand for the transport of articles a sum at least
double to what others of the trade would esteem a reasonable
recompense.&nbsp; By this means they accumulate large sums of
money, notwithstanding that they indulge themselves in far
superior fare to that which contents in general the parsimonious
Spaniard&mdash;another argument in favour of their pure Gothic
descent; for the Maragatos, like true men of the north, delight
in swilling liquors and battening upon gross and luscious meats,
which help to swell out their tall and goodly figures.&nbsp; Many
of them have died possessed of considerable riches, part of which
they have not unfrequently bequeathed to the erection or
embellishment of religious houses.</p>
<p>On the east end of the cathedral of Astorga, <a
name="citation324a"></a><a href="#footnote324a"
class="citation">[324a]</a> which towers over the lofty and
precipitous wall, a colossal figure of lead may be seen on the
roof.&nbsp; It is the statue of a Maragato carrier, who endowed
the cathedral with a large sum. <a name="citation324b"></a><a
href="#footnote324b" class="citation">[324b]</a>&nbsp; He is in
his national dress, but his head is averted from the land of his
fathers, and whilst he waves in his hand a species of flag, he
seems to be summoning his race from their unfruitful region to
other climes, where a richer field is open to their industry and
enterprise.</p>
<p><a name="page1_325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>I
spoke to several of these men respecting the all-important
subject of religion; but I found &ldquo;their hearts gross, and
their ears dull of hearing, and their eyes closed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was one in particular to whom I showed the New Testament,
and whom I addressed for a considerable time.&nbsp; He listened,
or seemed to listen, patiently, taking occasionally copious
draughts from an immense jug of whitish wine which stood between
his knees.&nbsp; After I had concluded, he said, &ldquo;To-morrow
I set out for Lugo, whither, I am told, yourself are going.&nbsp;
If you wish to send your chest, I have no objection to take it at
so much&rdquo; (naming an extravagant price).&nbsp; &ldquo;As for
what you have told me, I understand little of it, and believe not
a word of it; but in respect to the books which you have shown
me, I will take three or four.&nbsp; I shall not read them, it is
true, but I have no doubt that I can sell them at a higher price
than you demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the Maragatos.</p>

Rocks&mdash;Sunset&mdash;Cacabelos&mdash;Midnight

<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock of a beautiful morning when we
sallied from Astorga, or rather from its suburbs, in which we had
been lodged: we directed our course to the north, in the
direction of Galicia.&nbsp; Leaving the mountain Telleno on our
left, we passed along the eastern skirts of the land of the
Maragatos, over broken uneven ground, enlivened here and there by
small green valleys and runnels of water.&nbsp; Several of the
Maragatan women, mounted on donkeys, passed us on their way to
Astorga, whither they were carrying vegetables.&nbsp; We saw
others in the fields handling their rude ploughs, drawn by lean
oxen.&nbsp; We likewise passed through a small village, in which
we, however, saw no living soul.&nbsp; Near this village we
entered the high-road which leads direct from Madrid to Corunna,
and at last, having travelled near four leagues, we came to a
species of pass, formed on our left by a huge lumpish hill (one
of those which descend from the great mountain Telleno), and on
our right by one of much less altitude.&nbsp; In the middle of
this pass, <a name="page1_327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>which was of considerable breadth, a noble view opened
itself to us.&nbsp; Before us, at the distance of about a league
and a half, rose the mighty frontier chain, of which I have
spoken before; its blue sides and broken and picturesque peaks
still wearing a thin veil of the morning mist, which the fierce
rays of the sun were fast dispelling.&nbsp; It seemed an enormous
barrier, threatening to oppose our further progress, and it
reminded me of the fables respecting the children of Magog, <a
name="citation327a"></a><a href="#footnote327a"
class="citation">[327a]</a> who are said to reside in remotest
Tartary, behind a gigantic wall of rocks, which can only be
passed by a gate of steel a thousand cubits in height.</p>
<p>We shortly after arrived at Manzanal, <a
name="citation327b"></a><a href="#footnote327b"
class="citation">[327b]</a> a village consisting of wretched
huts, and exhibiting every sign of poverty and misery.&nbsp; It
was now time to refresh ourselves and horses, and we accordingly
put up at a <i>venta</i>, the last habitation in the village,
where, though we found barley for the animals, we had much
difficulty in procuring anything for ourselves.&nbsp; I was at
length fortunate enough to obtain a large jug of milk, for there
were plenty of cows in the neighbourhood, feeding in a
picturesque valley which we had passed by, where was abundance of
grass, and trees, and a rivulet broken by tiny cascades.&nbsp;
The jug might contain about half a gallon, but I emptied it in a
few minutes, for the thirst of fever was still burning within me,
though I was destitute of appetite.&nbsp; The <i>venta</i> had
something the appearance of a German <a
name="page1_328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>baiting-house.&nbsp; It consisted of an immense stable,
from which was partitioned a kind of kitchen and a place where
the family slept.&nbsp; The master, a robust young man, lolled on
a large solid stone bench, which stood within the door.&nbsp; He
was very inquisitive respecting news, but I could afford him
none, whereupon he became communicative, and gave me the history
of his life, the sum of which was, that he had been a courier in
the Basque provinces, but about a year since had been dispatched
to this village, where he kept the post-house.&nbsp; He was an
enthusiastic liberal, and spoke in bitter terms of the
surrounding population, who, he said, were all Carlists and
friends of the friars.&nbsp; I paid little attention to his
discourse, for I was looking at a Maragato lad of about fourteen,
who served in the house as a kind of ostler.&nbsp; I asked the
master if we were still in the land of the Maragatos; but he told
me that we had left it behind nearly a league, and that the lad
was an orphan, and was serving until he could rake up sufficient
capital to become an <i>arriero</i>.&nbsp; I addressed several
questions to the boy, but the urchin looked sullenly in my face,
and either answered by monosyllables or was doggedly
silent.&nbsp; I asked him if he could read.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as much as that brute of yours
which is tearing down the manger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quitting Manzanal, we continued our course.&nbsp; We soon
arrived at the verge of a deep valley amongst mountains&mdash;not
those of the chain which we had seen before us, and which we now
left to the right, but those of the Telleno range, just before
they unite with that chain.&nbsp; Round the sides of this valley,
which exhibited something of the appearance of a horse-shoe,
wound the road in a circuitous manner; just before <a
name="page1_329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>us,
however, and diverging from the road, lay a footpath, which
seemed, by a gradual descent, to lead across the valley, and to
rejoin the road on the other side, at the distance of about a
furlong, and into this we struck, in order to avoid the
circuit.</p>
<p>We had not gone far before we met two Galicians on their way
to cut the harvests of Castile.&nbsp; One of them shouted,
&ldquo;Cavalier, <a name="citation329"></a><a href="#footnote329"
class="citation">[329]</a> turn back: in a moment you will be
amongst precipices, where your horses will break their necks, for
we ourselves could scarcely climb them on foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
other cried, &ldquo;Cavalier, proceed, but be careful, and your
horses, if surefooted, will run no great danger: my comrade is a
fool.&rdquo;&nbsp; A violent dispute instantly ensued between the
two mountaineers, each supporting his opinion with loud oaths and
curses; but without stopping to see the result, I passed
on.&nbsp; But the path was now filled with stones and huge slaty
rocks, on which my horse was continually slipping.&nbsp; I
likewise heard the sound of water in a deep gorge, which I had
hitherto not perceived, and I soon saw that it would be worse
than madness to proceed.&nbsp; I turned my horse, and was
hastening to regain the path which I had left, when Antonio, my
faithful Greek, pointed out to me a meadow by which, he said, we
might regain the highroad much lower down than if we returned on
our steps.&nbsp; The meadow was brilliant with short green grass,
and in the middle there was a small rivulet of water.&nbsp; I
spurred my horse on, expecting to be in the high-road in a
moment; the horse, however, snorted and stared wildly, and was
evidently unwilling to cross the seemingly inviting spot.&nbsp; I
thought that <a name="page1_330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>the scent of a wolf or some other wild animal might
have disturbed him, but was soon undeceived by his sinking up to
the knees in a bog.&nbsp; The animal uttered a shrill sharp
neigh, and exhibited every sign of the greatest terror, making at
the same time great efforts to extricate himself, and plunging
forward, but every moment sinking deeper.&nbsp; At last he
arrived where a small vein of rock showed itself: on this he
placed his fore feet, and with one tremendous exertion freed
himself from the deceitful soil, springing over the rivulet and
alighting on comparatively firm ground, where he stood panting,
his heaving sides covered with a foamy sweat.&nbsp; Antonio, who
had observed the whole scene, afraid to venture forward, returned
by the path by which we came, and shortly afterwards rejoined
me.&nbsp; This adventure brought to my recollection the meadow
with its footpath which tempted Christian from the straight road
to heaven, and finally conducted him to the dominions of the
giant Despair.</p>
<p>We now began to descend the valley by a broad and excellent
<i>carretera</i> or carriage-road, which was cut out of the steep
side of the mountain on our right.&nbsp; On our left was the
gorge, down which tumbled the runnel of water which I have before
mentioned.&nbsp; The road was tortuous, and at every turn the
scene became more picturesque.&nbsp; The gorge gradually widened,
and the brook at its bottom, fed by a multitude of springs,
increased in volume and in sound; but it was soon far beneath us,
pursuing its headlong course till it reached level ground, where
it flowed in the midst of a beautiful but confined prairie.&nbsp;
There was something sylvan and savage in the mountains on the
farther side, clad from foot to pinnacle with trees, so closely
growing that the eye was unable to obtain a glimpse <a
name="page1_331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>of the
hillsides, which were uneven with ravines and gulleys, the haunts
of the wolf, the wild boar, and the <i>corso</i>, <a
name="citation331a"></a><a href="#footnote331a"
class="citation">[331a]</a> or mountain stag; the latter of
which, as I was informed by a peasant who was driving a car of
oxen, frequently descended to feed in the prairie, and were there
shot for the sake of their skins, for the flesh, being strong and
disagreeable, is held in no account.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the wildness of these regions, the
handiworks of man were visible.&nbsp; The sides of the gorge,
though precipitous, were yellow with little fields of barley, and
we saw a hamlet and church down in the prairie below, whilst
merry songs ascended to our ears from where the mowers were
toiling with their scythes, cutting the luxuriant and abundant
grass.&nbsp; I could scarcely believe that I was in Spain, in
general so brown, so arid and cheerless, and I almost fancied
myself in Greece, in that land of ancient glory, whose mountain
and forest scenery Theocritus <a name="citation331b"></a><a
href="#footnote331b" class="citation">[331b]</a> has so well
described.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the valley we entered a small village, washed
by the brook, which had now swelled almost to a stream.&nbsp; A
more romantic situation I had never witnessed.&nbsp; It was
surrounded, and almost overhung, by mountains, and embowered in
trees of various kinds; waters sounded, nightingales sang, and
the cuckoo&rsquo;s full note boomed from the distant branches,
but the village was miserable.&nbsp; The huts were built of slate
stones, of which the neighbouring hills seemed to be principally
composed, and roofed with the same, but not in the neat tidy
manner of English houses, <a name="page1_332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>for the slates were of all sizes and
seemed to be flung on in confusion.&nbsp; We were spent with heat
and thirst, and sitting down on a stone bench, I entreated a
woman to give me a little water.&nbsp; The woman said she would,
but added that she expected to be paid for it.&nbsp; Antonio, on
hearing this, became highly incensed, and speaking Greek,
Turkish, and Spanish, invoked the vengeance of the
<i>Panhagia</i> on the heartless woman, saying, &ldquo;If I were
to offer a Mahometan gold for a draught of water he would dash it
in my face; and you are a Catholic, with the stream running at
your door.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him to be silent, and giving the
woman two <i>cuartos</i>, repeated my request, whereupon she took
a pitcher, and going to the stream, filled it with water.&nbsp;
It tasted muddy and disagreeable, but it drowned the fever which
was devouring me.</p>
<p>We again remounted and proceeded on our way, which, for a
considerable distance, lay along the margin of the stream, which
now fell in small cataracts, now brawled over stones, and at
other times ran dark and silent through deep pools overhung with
tall willows,&mdash;pools which seemed to abound with the finny
tribe, for large trout frequently sprang from the water, catching
the brilliant fly which skimmed along its deceitful
surface.&nbsp; The scene was delightful.&nbsp; The sun was
rolling high in the firmament, casting from its orb of fire the
most glorious rays, so that the atmosphere was flickering with
their splendour; but their fierceness was either warded off by
the shadow of the trees, or rendered innocuous by the refreshing
coolness which rose from the waters, or by the gentle breezes
which murmured at intervals over the meadows, &ldquo;fanning the
cheek or raising the hair&rdquo; of the wanderer.&nbsp; The hills
gradually receded, till at last we entered a plain <a
name="page1_333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>where
tall grass was waving, and mighty chestnut trees, in full
blossom, spread out their giant and umbrageous boughs.&nbsp;
Beneath many stood cars, the tired oxen prostrate on the ground,
the cross-bar of the pole which they support pressing heavily on
their heads, whilst their drivers were either employed in
cooking, or were enjoying a delicious <i>siesta</i> in the grass
and shade.&nbsp; I went up to one of the largest of these groups
and demanded of the individuals whether they were in need of the
Testament of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; They stared at one another, and
then at me, till at last a young man, who was dangling a long gun
in his hands as he reclined, demanded of me what it was, at the
same time inquiring whether I was a Catalan, &ldquo;for you speak
hoarse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and are tall and fair like that
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; I sat down amongst them, and said that I was
no Catalan, but that I came from a spot in the Western Sea, many
leagues distant, to sell that book at half the price it cost; and
that their souls&rsquo; welfare depended on their being
acquainted with it.&nbsp; I then explained to them the nature of
the New Testament, and read to them the parable of the
Sower.&nbsp; They stared at each other again, but said that they
were poor, and could not buy books.&nbsp; I rose, mounted, and
was going away, saying to them, &ldquo;Peace bide with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the young man with the gun rose, and
saying, &ldquo;<i>Caspita</i>! this is odd,&rdquo; snatched the
book from my hand, and gave me the price I had demanded.</p>
<p>Perhaps the whole world might be searched in vain for a spot
whose natural charms could rival those of this plain or valley of
Bembibre, <a name="citation333"></a><a href="#footnote333"
class="citation">[333]</a> as it is called, with <a
name="page1_334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>its wall
of mighty mountains, its spreading chestnut trees, and its groves
of oaks and willows, which clothe the banks of its stream, a
tributary to the Minho.&nbsp; True it is, that when I passed
through it the candle of heaven was blazing in full splendour,
and everything lighted by its rays looked gay, glad, and
blessed.&nbsp; Whether it would have filled me with the same
feelings of admiration if viewed beneath another sky, I will not
pretend to determine; but it certainly possesses advantages which
at no time could fail to <a name="page1_335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>delight, for it exhibits all the
peaceful beauties of an English landscape blended with something
wild and grand, and I thought within myself that he must be a
restless, dissatisfied man, who, born amongst those scenes, would
wish to quit them.&nbsp; At the time I would have desired no
better fate than that of a shepherd on the prairies, or a hunter
on the hills of Bembibre.</p>
<p>Three hours passed away, and we were in another
situation.&nbsp; We had halted and refreshed ourselves and horses
at Bembibre, a village of mud and slate, and which possessed
little to attract attention.&nbsp; We were now ascending, for the
road was over one of the extreme ledges of those frontier hills
which I have before so often mentioned; but the aspect of heaven
had blackened, clouds were rolling rapidly from the west over the
mountains, and a cold wind was moaning dismally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a storm travelling through the air,&rdquo; said a
peasant, whom we overtook mounted on a wretched mule, &ldquo;and
the Asturians had better be on the look-out, for it is speeding
in their direction.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had scarce spoken when a
light, so vivid and dazzling that it seemed as if the whole
lustre of the fiery element were concentrated in it, broke around
us, filling the whole atmosphere, and covering rock, tree, and
mountain with a glare not to be described.&nbsp; The mule of the
peasant tumbled prostrate, while the horse I rode reared himself
perpendicularly, and, turning round, dashed down the hill at
headlong speed, which for some time it was impossible to
check.&nbsp; The lightning was followed by a peal almost as
terrible, but distant, for it sounded hollow and deep; the hills,
however, caught up its voice, seemingly repeating it from summit
to summit, till it was lost in interminable space.&nbsp; Other
flashes and peals succeeded, but slight <a
name="page1_336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>in
comparison, and a few drops of rain descended.&nbsp; The body of
the tempest seemed to be over another region.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
hundred families are weeping where that bolt fell,&rdquo; said
the peasant when I rejoined him, &ldquo;for its blaze has blinded
my mule at six leagues&rsquo; distance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
leading the animal by the bridle, as its sight was evidently
affected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were the friars still in their nest above
there,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I should say that this was
their doing, for they are the cause of all the miseries of the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I raised my eyes in the direction in which he pointed.&nbsp;
Halfway up the mountain, over whose foot we were wending, jutted
forth a black frightful, crag, which, at an immense altitude,
overhung the road, and seemed to threaten destruction.&nbsp; It
resembled one of those ledges of the rocky mountains in the
picture of the Deluge, up to which the terrified fugitives have
scrambled from the eager pursuit of the savage and tremendous
billows, and from whence they gaze down in horror, whilst above
them rise still higher and giddier heights, to which they seem
unable to climb.&nbsp; Built on the very edge of this crag stood
an edifice, seemingly devoted to the purposes of religion, as I
could discern the spire of a church rearing itself high over wall
and roof.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the house of the Virgin of the
Rocks,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;and it was lately full of
friars, but they have been thrust out, and the only inmates now
are owls and ravens.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, that their life in
such a bleak, exposed abode could not have been very enviable, as
in winter they must have incurred great risk of perishing with
cold.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they had
the best of wood for their <i>braseros</i> and chimneys, and the
best of wine to warm them at their meals, which were not the most
sparing.&nbsp; <a name="page1_337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>Moreover, they had another convent down in the vale
yonder, to which they could retire at their
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my asking him the reason of his
antipathy to the friars, he replied, that he had been their
vassal, and that they had deprived him every year of the flower
of what he possessed.&nbsp; Discoursing in this manner, we
reached a village just below the convent, where he left me,
having first pointed out to me a house of stone, with an image
over the door, which, he said, once belonged to the
<i>canalla</i> <a name="citation337a"></a><a href="#footnote337a"
class="citation">[337a]</a> above.</p>
<p>The sun was setting fast, and, eager to reach Villafranca, <a
name="citation337b"></a><a href="#footnote337b"
class="citation">[337b]</a> where I had determined on resting,
and which was still distant three leagues and a half, I made no
halt at this place.&nbsp; The road was now down a rapid and
crooked descent, which terminated in a valley, at the bottom of
which was a long and narrow bridge; beneath it rolled a river,
descending from a wide pass between two mountains, for the chain
was here cleft, probably by some convulsion of nature.&nbsp; I
looked up the pass, and on the hills on both sides.&nbsp; Far
above on my right, but standing forth bold and clear, and
catching the last rays of the sun, was the Convent of the
Precipices, whilst directly over against it, on the farther side
of the valley, rose the perpendicular side of the rival hill,
which, to a considerable extent intercepting the light, flung its
black shadow over the upper end of the pass, involving it in
mysterious darkness.&nbsp; Emerging from the centre of this
gloom, with thundering <a name="page1_338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>sound, dashed a river, white with
foam, and bearing along with it huge stones and branches of
trees, for it was the wild Sil hurrying to the ocean from its
cradle in the heart of the Asturian hills, and probably swollen
by the recent rains.</p>
<p>Hours again passed away.&nbsp; It was now night, and we were
in the midst of woodlands, feeling our way, for the darkness was
so great that I could scarcely see the length of a yard before my
horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The animal seemed uneasy, and would
frequently stop short, prick up his ears, and utter a low
mournful whine.&nbsp; Flashes of sheet lightning frequently
illumined the black sky, and flung a momentary glare over our
path.&nbsp; No sound interrupted the stillness of the night,
except the slow tramp of the horses&rsquo; hoofs, and
occasionally the croaking of frogs from some pool or
morass.&nbsp; I now bethought me that I was in Spain, the chosen
land of the two fiends&mdash;assassination and plunder&mdash;and
how easily two tired and unarmed wanderers might become their
victims.</p>
<p>We at last cleared the woodlands, and, after proceeding a
short distance, the horse gave a joyous neigh, and broke into a
smart trot.&nbsp; A barking of dogs speedily reached my ears, and
we seemed to be approaching some town or village.&nbsp; In effect
we were close to Cacabelos, a town about five miles distant from
Villafranca.</p>
<p>It was near eleven at night, and I reflected that it would be
far more expedient to tarry in this place till the morning than
to attempt at present to reach Villafranca, exposing ourselves to
all the horrors of darkness in a lonely and unknown road.&nbsp;
My mind was soon made up on this point; but I reckoned without my
host, for at the first <i>posada</i> which I attempted to <a
name="page1_339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>enter I
was told that we could not be accommodated, and still less our
horses, as the stable was full of water.&nbsp; At the second, and
there were but two, I was answered from the window by a gruff
voice, nearly in the words of Scripture: &ldquo;Trouble me not:
the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I
cannot arise to let you in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, we had no
particular desire to enter, as it appeared a wretched hovel,
though the poor horses pawed piteously against the door, and
seemed to crave admittance.</p>
<p>We had now no choice but to resume our doleful way to
Villafranca, which we were told was a short league distant,
though it proved a league and a half.&nbsp; We found it no easy
matter to quit the town, for we were bewildered amongst its
labyrinths, and could not find the outlet.&nbsp; A lad about
eighteen was, however, persuaded, by the promise of a
<i>peseta</i>, to guide us: whereupon he led us by many turnings
to a bridge, which he told us to cross, and to follow the road,
which was that of Villafranca; he then, having received his fee,
hastened from us.</p>
<p>We followed his directions, not, however, without a suspicion
that he might be deceiving us.&nbsp; The night had settled darker
down upon us, so that it was impossible to distinguish any
object, however nigh.&nbsp; The lightning had become more faint
and rare.&nbsp; We heard the rustling of trees, and occasionally
the barking of dogs, which last sound, however, soon ceased, and
we were in the midst of night and silence.&nbsp; My horse, either
from weariness or the badness of the road, frequently stumbled;
whereupon I dismounted, and leading him by the bridle, soon left
Antonio far in the rear.</p>
<p>I had proceeded in this manner a considerable way, <a
name="page1_340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>when a
circumstance occurred of a character well suited to the time and
place.</p>
<p>I was again amidst trees and bushes, when the horse, stopping
short, nearly pulled me back.&nbsp; I know not how it was, but
fear suddenly came over me, which, though in darkness and in
solitude, I had not felt before.&nbsp; I was about to urge the
animal forward, when I heard a noise at my right hand, and
listened attentively.&nbsp; It seemed to be that of a person or
persons forcing their way through branches and brushwood.&nbsp;
It soon ceased, and I heard feet on the road.&nbsp; It was the
short staggering kind of tread of people carrying a very heavy
substance, nearly too much for their strength, and I thought I
heard the hurried breathing of men over-fatigued.&nbsp; There was
a short pause, during which I conceived they were resting in the
middle of the road; then the stamping recommenced, until it
reached the other side, when I again heard a similar rustling
amidst branches; it continued for some time, and died gradually
away.</p>
<p>I continued my road, musing on what had just occurred, and
forming conjectures as to the cause.&nbsp; The lightning resumed
its flashing, and I saw that I was approaching tall black
mountains.</p>
<p>This nocturnal journey endured so long that I almost lost all
hope of reaching the town, and had closed my eyes in a doze,
though I still trudged on mechanically, leading the horse.&nbsp;
Suddenly a voice at a slight distance before me roared out,
&ldquo;<i>Quien vive</i>?&rdquo; for I had at last found my way
to Villafranca.&nbsp; It proceeded from the sentry in the suburb,
one of those singular half soldiers, half <i>guerillas</i>, <a
name="citation340"></a><a href="#footnote340"
class="citation">[340]</a> called <a name="page1_341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>Miguelets, who are in general
employed by the Spanish government to clear the roads of
robbers.&nbsp; I gave the usual answer,
&ldquo;<i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>,&rdquo; and went up to the place
where he stood.&nbsp; After a little conversation, I sat down on
a stone, awaiting the arrival of Antonio, who was long in making
his appearance.&nbsp; On his arrival, I asked if any one had
passed him on the road, but he replied that he had seen
nothing.&nbsp; The night, or rather the morning, was still very
dark, though a small corner of the moon was occasionally
visible.&nbsp; On our inquiring the way to the gate, the Miguelet
directed us down a street to the left, which we followed.&nbsp;
The street was steep, we could see no gate, and our progress was
soon stopped by houses and wall.&nbsp; We knocked at the gates of
two or three of these houses (in the upper stories of which
lights were burning), for the purpose of being set right, but we
were either disregarded or not heard.&nbsp; A horrid squalling of
cats, from the tops of the houses and dark corners, saluted our
ears, and I thought of the night arrival of Don Quixote and his
squire at Toboso, and their vain search amongst the deserted
streets for the palace of Dulcinea. <a name="citation341"></a><a
href="#footnote341" class="citation">[341]</a>&nbsp; At length we
saw light and heard voices in a cottage at the other side of a
kind of ditch.&nbsp; Leading the horses over, we called at the <a
name="page1_342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>door,
which was opened by an aged man, who appeared by his dress to be
a baker, as indeed he proved, which accounted for his being up at
so late an hour.&nbsp; On begging him to show us the way into the
town, he led us up a very narrow alley at the end of his cottage,
saying that he would likewise conduct us to the
<i>posada</i>.</p>
<p>The alley led directly to what appeared to be the
market-place, at a corner house of which our guide stopped and
knocked.&nbsp; After a long pause an upper window was opened, and
a female voice demanded who we were.&nbsp; The old man replied,
that two travellers had arrived who were in need of
lodgings.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot be disturbed at this time of
night,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;they will be wanting supper,
and there is nothing in the house; they must go
elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was going to shut the window, but I
cried that we wanted no supper, but merely a resting-place for
ourselves and horses&mdash;that we had come that day from
Astorga, and were dying with fatigue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that
speaking?&rdquo; cried the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely that is the
voice of Gil, the German clockmaker from Pontevedra.&nbsp;
Welcome, old companion; you are come at the right time, for my
own is out of order.&nbsp; I am sorry I have kept you waiting,
but I will admit you in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window was slammed to, presently a light shone through the
crevices of the door, a key turned in the lock, and we were
admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;whom have we
here?&nbsp; This is not Gil the clockmaker.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whether it be Gil or Juan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are in
need of your hospitality, and can pay for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
first care was to stable the horses, who were much
exhausted.&nbsp; We then went in search of some accommodation for
ourselves.&nbsp; The house was large and commodious, and, having
tasted a little water, I stretched myself on the floor of one of
the rooms on some mattresses which the woman produced, and in
less than a minute was sound asleep.</p>
<p>The sun was shining bright when I awoke.&nbsp; I walked forth
into the market-place, which was crowded with people.&nbsp; I
looked up, and could see the peaks of tall black mountains
peeping over the tops of the houses.&nbsp; The town lay in a deep
hollow, and appeared to be surrounded by hills on almost every
side.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Quel pays barbare</i>!&rdquo; said Antonio,
who now joined me; &ldquo;the farther we go, my master, the
wilder everything <a name="page1_344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>looks.&nbsp; I am half afraid to
venture into Galicia; they tell me that to get to it we must
clamber up those hills: the horses will founder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Leaving the marketplace, I ascended the wall of the town, and
endeavoured to discover the gate by which we should have entered
the preceding night; but I was not more successful in the bright
sunshine than in the darkness.&nbsp; The town in the direction of
Astorga appeared to be hermetically sealed.</p>
<p>I was eager to enter Galicia, and finding that the horses were
to a certain extent recovered from the fatigue of the journey of
the preceding day, we again mounted and proceeded on our
way.&nbsp; Crossing a bridge, we presently found ourselves in a
deep gorge amongst the mountains, down which rushed an impetuous
rivulet, overhung by the high-road which leads into
Galicia.&nbsp; We were in the far-famed pass of Fuencebadon.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe this pass or the circumjacent
region, which contains some of the most extraordinary scenery in
all Spain; a feeble and imperfect outline is all that I can hope
to effect.&nbsp; The traveller who ascends it follows for nearly
a league the course of the torrent, whose banks are in some
places precipitous, and in others slope down to the waters, and
are covered with lofty trees, oaks, poplars, and chestnuts.&nbsp;
Small villages are at first continually seen, with low walls, and
roofs formed of immense slates, the eaves nearly touching the
ground; these hamlets, however, gradually become less frequent as
the path grows more steep and narrow, until they finally cease at
a short distance before the spot is attained where the rivulet is
abandoned, and is no more seen, though its tributaries may yet be
heard in many a gully, or <a name="page1_345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>descried in tiny rills dashing down
the steeps.&nbsp; Everything here is wild, strange, and
beautiful: the hill up which winds the path towers above on the
right, whilst on the farther side of a profound ravine rises an
immense mountain, to whose extreme altitudes the eye is scarcely
able to attain; but the most singular feature of this pass are
the hanging fields or meadows which cover its sides.&nbsp; In
these, as I passed, the grass was growing luxuriantly, and in
many the mowers were plying their scythes, though it seemed
scarcely possible that their feet could find support on ground so
precipitous; above and below were driftways, so small as to seem
threads along the mountain side.&nbsp; A car, drawn by oxen, is
creeping round yon airy eminence; the nearer wheel is actually
hanging over the horrid descent; giddiness seizes the brain, and
the eye is rapidly withdrawn.&nbsp; A cloud intervenes, and when
again you turn to watch their progress, the objects of your
anxiety have disappeared.&nbsp; Still more narrow becomes the
path along which you yourself are toiling, and its turns more
frequent.&nbsp; You have already come a distance of two leagues,
and still one-third of the ascent remains unsurmounted.&nbsp; You
are not yet in Galicia; and you still hear Castilian, coarse and
unpolished, it is true, spoken in the miserable cabins placed in
the sequestered nooks which you pass by in your route.</p>
<p>Shortly before we reached the summit of the pass thick mists
began to envelope the tops of the hills, and a drizzling rain
descended.&nbsp; &ldquo;These mists,&rdquo; said Antonio,
&ldquo;are what the Gallegans call <i>bretima</i>; and it is said
there is never any lack of them in their country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you ever visited the country before?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Non</i>, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>; but I
have frequently lived in houses where the domestics were in <a
name="page1_346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>part
Gallegans, on which account I know not a little of their ways,
and even something of their language.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the
opinion which you have formed of them at all in their
favour?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>; the men in general seem clownish and simple,
yet they are capable of deceiving the most clever <i>filou</i> of
Paris; and as for the women, it is impossible to live in the same
house with them, more especially if they are <i>camareras</i>,
and wait upon the <i>se&ntilde;ora</i>; they are continually
breeding dissensions and disputes in the house, and telling tales
of the other domestics.&nbsp; I have already lost two or three
excellent situations in Madrid, solely owing to these Gallegan
chambermaids.&nbsp; We have now come to the frontier, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>, for such I conceive this village to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered the village, which stood on the summit of the
mountain, and, as our horses and ourselves were by this time much
fatigued, we looked round for a place in which to obtain
refreshment.&nbsp; Close by the gate stood a building which, from
the circumstance of a mule or two and a wretched pony standing
before it, we concluded was the <i>posada</i>, as in effect it
proved to be.&nbsp; We entered: several soldiers were lolling on
heaps of coarse hay, with which the place, which much resembled a
stable, was half filled.&nbsp; All were exceedingly ill-looking
fellows, and very dirty.&nbsp; They were conversing with each
other in a strange-sounding dialect, which I supposed to be
Gallegan.&nbsp; Scarcely did they perceive us when two or three
of them, starting from their couch, ran up to Antonio, whom they
welcomed with much affection, calling him
<i>companheiro</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;How came you to know these
men?&rdquo; I demanded in French: &ldquo;<i>Ces messieurs sont
presque tous de ma connoissance</i>,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;<i>et</i>, <i>entre nous</i>, <i>ce sont de </i><a
name="page1_347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span><i>v&eacute;ritables vauriens</i>; they are almost all
robbers and assassins.&nbsp; That fellow with one eye, who is the
corporal, escaped a little time ago from Madrid, more than
suspected of being concerned in an affair of poisoning; but he is
safe enough here in his own country, and is placed to guard the
frontier, as you see? but we must treat them civilly, <i>man
ma&icirc;tre</i>; we must give them wine, or they will be
offended.&nbsp; I know them, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>&mdash;I know
them.&nbsp; Here, hostess, bring an <i>azumbre</i> of
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst Antonio was engaged in treating his friends, I led the
horses to the stable; this was through the house, inn, or
whatever it might be called.&nbsp; The stable was a wretched
shed, in which the horses sank to their fetlocks in mud and
puddle.&nbsp; On inquiring for barley, I was told that I was now
in Galicia, where barley was not used for provender, and was very
rare.&nbsp; I was offered in lieu of it Indian corn, which,
however, the horses ate without hesitation.&nbsp; There was no
straw to be had; coarse hay, half green, being the
substitute.&nbsp; By trampling about in the mud of the stable my
horse soon lost a shoe, for which I searched in vain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is there a blacksmith in the village?&rdquo; I demanded of
a shock-headed fellow who officiated as ostler.</p>
<p><i>Ostler</i>.&mdash;<i>Si</i>, <i>Senhor</i>; <a
name="citation347"></a><a href="#footnote347"
class="citation">[347]</a> but I suppose you have brought
horseshoes with you, or that large beast of yours cannot be shod
in this village.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What do you mean?&nbsp; Is the blacksmith
unequal to his trade?&nbsp; Cannot he put on a horseshoe?</p>
<p><i>Ostler</i>.&mdash;<i>Si</i>, <i>Senhor</i>; he can put on a
horseshoe, <a name="page1_348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>if you give it him; but there are no horseshoes in
Galicia, at least in these parts.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Is it not customary, then, to shoe the
horses in Galicia?</p>
<p><i>Ostler</i>.&mdash;<i>Senhor</i>, there are no horses in
Galicia, there are only ponies; and those who bring horses to
Galicia&mdash;and none but madmen ever do&mdash;must bring shoes
to fit them; only shoes of ponies are to be found here.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What do you mean by saying that only
madmen bring horses to Galicia?</p>
<p><i>Ostler</i>.&mdash;<i>Senhor</i>, no horse can stand the
food of Galicia and the mountains of Galicia long, without
falling sick; and then, if he does not die at once, he will cost
you in farriers more than he is worth.&nbsp; Besides, a horse is
of no use here, and cannot perform amongst the broken ground the
tenth part of the service which a little pony mare can.&nbsp;
By-the-by, <i>Senhor</i>, I perceive that yours is an entire
horse; now out of twenty ponies that you see on the roads of
Galicia, nineteen are mares; the males are sent down into Castile
to be sold.&nbsp; <i>Senhor</i>, your horse will become heated on
our roads, and will catch the bad glanders, for which there is no
remedy.&nbsp; <i>Senhor</i>, a man must be mad to bring any horse
to Galicia, but twice mad to bring an <i>entero</i>, as you have
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange country this of Galicia,&rdquo; said I, and
went to consult with Antonio.</p>
<p>It appeared that the information of the ostler was literally
true with regard to the horseshoe; at least, the blacksmith of
the village, to whom we conducted the animal, confessed his
inability to shoe him, having none that would fit his hoof.&nbsp;
He said it was very probable that we should be obliged to lead
the animal to Lugo, which being a cavalry station, we might <a
name="page1_349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>perhaps
find there what we wanted.&nbsp; He added, however, that the
greatest part of the cavalry soldiers were mounted on the ponies
of the country, the mortality amongst the horses brought from the
level ground into Galicia being frightful.&nbsp; Lugo was ten
leagues distant: there seemed, however, to be no remedy at hand
but patience, and, having refreshed ourselves, we proceeded,
leading our horses by the bridle.</p>
<p>We were now on level ground, being upon the very top of one of
the highest mountains in Galicia.&nbsp; This level continued for
about a league, when we began to descend.&nbsp; Before we had
crossed the plain, which was overgrown with furze and brushwood,
we came suddenly upon half a dozen fellows, armed with muskets,
and wearing a tattered uniform.&nbsp; We at first supposed them
to be banditti: they were, however, only a party of soldiers, who
had been detached from the station we had just quitted to escort
one of the provincial posts or couriers.&nbsp; They were
clamorous for cigars, but offered us no further incivility.&nbsp;
Having no cigars to bestow, I gave them in lieu thereof a small
piece of silver.&nbsp; Two of the worst looking were very eager
to be permitted to escort us to Nogales, the village where we
proposed to spend the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means permit
them, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said Antonio.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are two famous assassins of my acquaintance; I have
known them at Madrid.&nbsp; In the first ravine they will shoot
and plunder us.&rdquo;&nbsp; I therefore civilly declined their
offer and departed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to be acquainted with
all the cut-throats in Galicia,&rdquo; said I to Antonio, as we
descended the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to those two fellows,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I knew them when I lived as cook in the family of General
Q---, who is a Gallegan: they were sworn <a
name="page1_350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>friends
of the <i>repostero</i>.&nbsp; All the Gallegans in Madrid know
each other, whether high or low makes no difference; there, at
least, they are all good friends, and assist each other on all
imaginable occasions; and if there be a Gallegan domestic in a
house, the kitchen is sure to be filled with his countrymen, as
the cook frequently knows to his cost, for they generally
contrive to eat up any little perquisites which he may have
reserved for himself and family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat less than halfway down the mountain we reached a
small village.&nbsp; On observing a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, we
stopped, in the faint hope of finding a shoe for the horse, who,
for want of one, was rapidly becoming lame.&nbsp; To our great
joy we found that the smith was in possession of one single
horseshoe, which some time previously he had found upon the
way.&nbsp; This, after undergoing much hammering and alteration,
was pronounced by the Gallegan Vulcan to be capable of serving in
lieu of a better; whereupon we again mounted, and slowly
continued our descent.</p>
<p>Shortly ere sunset we arrived at Nogales, a hamlet situate in
a narrow valley at the foot of the mountain, in traversing which
we had spent the day.&nbsp; Nothing could be more picturesque
than the appearance of this spot: steep hills, thickly clad with
groves and forests of chestnuts, surrounded it on every side; the
village itself was almost embowered in trees, and close beside it
ran a purling brook.&nbsp; Here we found a tolerably large and
commodious <i>posada</i>.</p>
<p>I was languid and fatigued, but felt little desire to
sleep.&nbsp; Antonio cooked our supper, or rather his own, for I
had no appetite.&nbsp; I sat by the door, gazing at the
wood-covered heights above me, or on the waters of the rivulet,
occasionally listening to the <a name="page1_351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>people who lounged about the house,
conversing in the country dialect.&nbsp; What a strange tongue is
the Gallegan, with its half-singing, half-whining accent, and
with its confused jumble of words from many languages, but
chiefly from the Spanish and Portuguese! <a
name="citation351"></a><a href="#footnote351"
class="citation">[351]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you understand this
conversation?&rdquo; I demanded of Antonio, who had by this time
rejoined me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot, <i>mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I have acquired at
various times a great many words amongst the Gallegan domestics
in the kitchens where I have officiated as cook, but am quite
unable to understand any long conversation.&nbsp; I have heard
the Gallegans say that in no two villages is it spoken in one and
the same manner, and that very frequently they do not understand
each other.&nbsp; The worst of this language is, that everybody
on first hearing it thinks that nothing is more easy than to
understand it, as words are continually occurring which he has
heard before; but these merely serve to bewilder and puzzle him,
causing him to misunderstand everything that is said; whereas, if
<a name="page1_352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>he
were totally ignorant of the tongue, he would occasionally give a
shrewd guess at what was meant, as I myself frequently do when I
hear Basque spoken, though the only word which I know of that
language is <i>jaunguicoa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the night closed in I retired to bed, where I remained four
or five hours, restless and tossing about, the fever of Leon
still clinging to my system.&nbsp; It was considerably past
midnight when, just as I was sinking into a slumber, I was
aroused by a confused noise in the village, and the glare of
lights through the lattice of the window of the room where I lay;
presently entered Antonio, half dressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon
ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the grand post from
Madrid to Corunna has just arrived in the village, attended by a
considerable escort, and an immense number of travellers.&nbsp;
The road, they say, between here and Lugo is infested with
robbers and Carlists, who are committing all kinds of atrocities;
let us, therefore, avail ourselves of the opportunity, and by
midday to-morrow we shall find ourselves safe in
Lugo.&rdquo;&nbsp; On hearing these words, I instantly sprang out
of bed and dressed myself, telling Antonio to prepare the horses
with all speed.</p>
<p>We were soon mounted and in the street, amidst a confused
throng of men and quadrupeds.&nbsp; The light of a couple of
flambeaus, which were borne before the courier, shone on the arms
of several soldiers, seemingly drawn up on either side of the
road; the darkness, however, prevented me from distinguishing
objects very clearly.&nbsp; The courier himself was mounted on a
little shaggy pony; before and behind him were two immense
portmanteaus, or leather sacks, the ends of which nearly touched
the ground.&nbsp; For about a quarter of an hour there was much
hubbub, shouting, <a name="page1_353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>and trampling, at the end of which
period the order was given to proceed.&nbsp; Scarcely had we left
the village when the flambeaus were extinguished, and we were
left in almost total darkness; for some time we were amongst
woods and trees, as was evident from the rustling of leaves on
every side.&nbsp; My horse was very uneasy and neighed fearfully,
occasionally raising himself bolt upright.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your
horse is not more quiet, cavalier, we shall be obliged to shoot
him,&rdquo; said a voice in an Andalusian accent; &ldquo;he
disturbs the whole cavalcade.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That would be a
pity, sergeant,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;for he is a Cordovese by
the four sides; he is not used to the ways of this barbarous
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, he is a Cordovese,&rdquo; said
the voice; &ldquo;<i>vaya</i>, I did not know that; I am from
Cordova myself.&nbsp; <i>Pobrecito</i>! let me pat him&mdash;yes,
I know by his coat that he is my countryman.&nbsp; Shoot him,
indeed! <i>vaya</i>, I would fain see the Gallegan devil who
would dare to harm him.&nbsp; Barbarous country, <i>yo lo
creo</i>: <a name="citation353"></a><a href="#footnote353"
class="citation">[353]</a> neither oil nor olives, bread nor
barley.&nbsp; You have been at Cordova.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>; oblige
me, cavalier, by taking this cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this manner we proceeded for several hours, up hill and
down dale, but generally at a very slow pace.&nbsp; The soldiers
who escorted us from time to time sang patriotic songs, breathing
love and attachment to the young Queen Isabel, and detestation of
the grim tyrant Carlos.&nbsp; One of the stanzas which reached my
ears ran something in the following style:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Don Carlos is a hoary churl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cruel heart and cold;<br />
But Isabel&rsquo;s a harmless girl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of only six years old.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page1_354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>At
last the day began to break, and I found myself amidst a train of
two or three hundred people, some on foot, but the greater part
mounted, either on mules or the pony mares: I could not
distinguish a single horse except my own and
Antonio&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A few soldiers were thinly scattered along
the road.&nbsp; The country was hilly, but less mountainous and
picturesque than the one which we had traversed the preceding
day; it was for the most part partitioned into small fields,
which were planted with maize.&nbsp; At the distance of every two
or three leagues we changed our escort, at some village where was
stationed a detachment.&nbsp; The villages were mostly an
assemblage of wretched cabins; the roofs were thatched, dank, and
moist, and not unfrequently covered with rank vegetation.&nbsp;
There were dung-hills before the doors, and no lack of pools and
puddles.&nbsp; Immense swine were stalking about, intermingled
with naked children.&nbsp; The interior of the cabins
corresponded with their external appearance: they were filled
with filth and misery.</p>
<p>We reached Lugo about two hours past noon.&nbsp; During the
last two or three leagues I became so overpowered with weariness,
the result of want of sleep and my late illness, that I was
continually dozing in my saddle, so that I took but little notice
of what was passing.&nbsp; We put up at a large <i>posada</i>
without the wall of the town, built upon a steep bank, and
commanding an extensive view of the country towards the
east.&nbsp; Shortly after our arrival, the rain began to descend
in torrents, and continued without intermission during the next
two days, which was, however, to me but a slight source of
regret, as I passed the entire time in bed, and I may almost say
in slumber.&nbsp; On the evening of the third day I arose.</p>
<p><a name="page1_355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>There was much bustle in the house, caused by the
arrival of a family from Corunna; they came in a large jaunting
car, escorted by four carabineers.&nbsp; The family was rather
numerous, consisting of a father, son, and eleven daughters, the
eldest of whom might be about eighteen.&nbsp; A shabby-looking
fellow, dressed in a jerkin and wearing a high-crowned hat,
attended as domestic.&nbsp; They arrived very wet and shivering,
and all seemed very disconsolate, especially the father, who was
a well-looking middle-aged man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can we be
accommodated?&rdquo; he demanded in a gentle voice of the man of
the house; &ldquo;can we be accommodated in this
<i>fonda</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your worship,&rdquo; replied the other;
&ldquo;our house is large.&nbsp; How many apartments does your
worship require for your family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One will be sufficient,&rdquo; replied the
stranger.</p>
<p>The host, who was a gouty personage and leaned upon a stick,
looked for a moment at the traveller, then at every member of his
family, not forgetting the domestic, and, without any farther
comment than a slight shrug, led the way to the door of an
apartment containing two or three flock beds, and which on my
arrival I had objected to as being small, dark, and incommodious;
this he flung open, and demanded whether it would serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather small,&rdquo; replied the gentleman;
&ldquo;I think, however, that it will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; replied the host.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall we make any preparations for the supper of your
worship and family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;my
own domestic will prepare the slight refreshment we are in need
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>The
key was delivered to the domestic, and the whole family ensconced
themselves in their apartment: before, however, this was
effected, the escort were dismissed, the principal carabineer
being presented with a <i>peseta</i>.&nbsp; The man stood
surveying the gratuity for about half a minute, as it glittered
in the palm of his hand; then with an abrupt <i>Vamos</i>! he
turned upon his heel, and without a word of salutation to any
person, departed with the men under his command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can these strangers be?&rdquo; said I to the host,
as we sat together in a large corridor open on one side, and
which occupied the entire front of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but by their
escort I suppose they are people holding some official
situation.&nbsp; They are not of this province, however, and I
more than suspect them to be Andalusians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the door of the apartment occupied by the
strangers was opened, and the domestic appeared, bearing a cruise
in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, <i>Se&ntilde;or
Patron</i>,&rdquo; demanded he, &ldquo;where can I buy some
oil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is oil in the house,&rdquo; replied the host,
&ldquo;if you want to purchase any; but if, as is probable, you
suppose that we shall gain a <i>cuarto</i> by selling it, you
will find some over the way.&nbsp; It is as I suspected,&rdquo;
continued the host, when the man had departed on his errand;
&ldquo;they are Andalusians, and are about to make what they call
<i>gazpacho</i>, on which they will all sup.&nbsp; Oh, the
meanness of these Andalusians! they are come here to suck the
vitals of Galicia, and yet envy the poor innkeeper the gain of a
<i>cuarto</i> in the oil which they require for their <a
name="page1_357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span><i>gazpacho</i>.&nbsp; I tell you one thing, master,
when that fellow returns, and demands bread and garlic to mix
with the oil, I will tell him there is none in the house: as he
has bought the oil abroad, so he may the bread and garlic; ay,
and the water too, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Lugo I found a wealthy bookseller, to whom I brought a
letter of recommendation from Madrid.&nbsp; He willingly
undertook the sale of my books.&nbsp; The Lord deigned to favour
my feeble exertions in his cause at Lugo.&nbsp; I brought thither
thirty Testaments, all of which were disposed of in one day; the
bishop of the place&mdash;for Lugo is an episcopal
see&mdash;purchasing two copies for himself, whilst several
priests and ex-friars, instead of following the example of their
brethren at Leon, by persecuting the work, spoke well of it and
recommended its perusal.&nbsp; I was much grieved that my stock
of these holy books was exhausted, there being a great demand;
and had I been able to supply them, quadruple the quantity might
have been sold during the few days that I continued at Lugo.</p>
<p>Lugo contains about six thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; It is
situated on lofty ground, and is defended by ancient walls.&nbsp;
It possesses no very remarkable edifice, and the cathedral church
itself is a small mean <a name="page1_359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>building.&nbsp; In the centre of the
town is the principal square, a light cheerful place, not
surrounded by those heavy cumbrous buildings with which the
Spaniards both in ancient and modern times have encircled their
plazas.&nbsp; It is singular enough that Lugo, at present a place
of very little importance, should at one period have been the
capital of Spain; <a name="citation359"></a><a
href="#footnote359" class="citation">[359]</a> yet such it was in
the time of the Romans, who, as they were a people not much
guided by caprice, had doubtless very excellent reasons for the
preference which they gave to the locality.</p>
<p>There are many Roman remains in the vicinity of this place,
the most remarkable of which are the ruins of the ancient
medicinal baths, which stand on the southern side of the river
Minho, which creeps through the valley beneath the town.&nbsp;
The Minho in this place is a dark and sullen stream, with high,
precipitous, and thickly wooded banks.</p>
<p>One evening I visited the baths, accompanied by my friend the
bookseller.&nbsp; They had been built over warm springs which
flow into the river.&nbsp; Notwithstanding their ruinous
condition, they were crowded with sick, hoping to derive benefit
from the waters, which are still famed for their sanative
power.&nbsp; These <a name="page1_360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>patients exhibited a strange
spectacle as, wrapped in flannel gowns much resembling shrouds,
they lay immersed in the tepid waters amongst disjointed stones,
and overhung with steam and reek.</p>
<p>Three or four days after my arrival I was seated in the
corridor, which, as I have already observed, occupied the entire
front of the house.&nbsp; The sky was unclouded, and the sun
shone most gloriously, enlivening every object around.&nbsp;
Presently the door of the apartment in which the strangers were
lodged opened, and forth walked the whole family, with the
exception of the father, who, I presumed, was absent on
business.&nbsp; The shabby domestic brought up the rear, and on
leaving the apartment, carefully locked the door, and secured the
key in his pocket.&nbsp; The one son and the eleven daughters
were all dressed remarkably well: the boy something after the
English fashion, in jacket and trousers, the young ladies in
spotless white.&nbsp; They were, upon the whole, a very
good-looking family, with dark eyes and olive complexions, but
the eldest daughter was remarkably handsome.&nbsp; They arranged
themselves upon the benches of the corridor, the shabby domestic
sitting down amongst them without any ceremony whatever.&nbsp;
They continued for some time in silence, gazing with disconsolate
looks upon the houses of the suburb and the dark walls of the
town, until the eldest daughter, or <i>se&ntilde;orita</i> as she
was called, broke silence with an &lsquo;<i>Ay Dios
mio</i>!&rsquo; <a name="citation360"></a><a href="#footnote360"
class="citation">[360]</a></p>
<p><i>Domestic</i>.&mdash;<i>Ay Dios mio</i>! we have found our
way to a pretty country.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I really can see nothing so very bad in
the country, which is by nature the richest in all <a
name="page1_361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>Spain,
and the most abundant.&nbsp; True it is that the generality of
the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, but they themselves are to
blame, and not the country.</p>
<p><i>Domestic</i>.&mdash;Cavalier, the country is a horrible
one, say nothing to the contrary.&nbsp; We are all frightened,
the young ladies, the young gentleman, and myself; even his
worship is frightened, and says that we are come to this country
for our sins.&nbsp; It rains every day, and this is almost the
first time that we have seen the sun since our arrival.&nbsp; It
rains continually, and one cannot step out without being up to
the ankles in <i>fango</i>; and then, again, there is not a house
to be found.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I scarcely understand you.&nbsp; There
appears to be no lack of houses in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p><i>Domestic</i>.&mdash;Excuse me, sir.&nbsp; His worship hired
yesterday a house, for which he engaged to pay fourteen-pence
daily; but when the <i>se&ntilde;orita</i> saw it, she wept, and
said it was no house, but a hog-stye, so his worship paid one
day&rsquo;s rent and renounced his bargain.&nbsp; Fourteen-pence
a day! why, in our country, we can have a palace for that
money.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;From what country do you come?</p>
<p><i>Domestic</i>.&mdash;Cavalier, you appear to be a decent
gentleman, and I will tell you our history.&nbsp; We are from
Andalusia, and his worship was last year receiver-general for
Granada: his salary was fourteen thousand <i>reals</i>, with
which we contrived to live very commodiously&mdash;attending the
bull <i>funcions</i> regularly, or if there were no bulls, we
went to see the <i>novillos</i>, <a name="citation361"></a><a
href="#footnote361" class="citation">[361]</a> <a
name="page1_362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>and now
and then to the opera.&nbsp; In a word, sir, we had our
diversions and felt at our ease; so much so that his worship was
actually thinking of purchasing a pony for the young gentleman,
who is fourteen, and must learn to ride now or never.&nbsp;
Cavalier, the ministry was changed, and the new-comers, who were
no friends to his worship, deprived him of his situation.&nbsp;
Cavalier, they removed us from that blessed country of Granada,
where our salary was fourteen thousand <i>reals</i>, and sent us
to Galicia, to this fatal town of Lugo, where his worship is
compelled to serve for ten thousand, which is quite insufficient
to maintain us in our former comforts.&nbsp; Good-bye, I trow, to
bull <i>funcions</i>, and <i>novillos</i>, and the opera.&nbsp;
Good-bye to the hope of a horse for the young gentleman.&nbsp;
Cavalier, I grow desperate: hold your tongue, for God&rsquo;s
sake! for I can talk no more.</p>
<p>On hearing this history I no longer wondered that the
receiver-general was eager to save a <i>cuarto</i> in the
purchase of the oil for the <i>gazpacho</i> of himself and family
of eleven daughters, one son, and a domestic.</p>
<p>We staid one week at Lugo, and then directed our steps to
Corunna, about twelve leagues distant.&nbsp; We arose before
daybreak in order to avail ourselves of the escort of the general
post, in whose company we travelled upwards of six leagues.&nbsp;
There was much talk of robbers, and flying parties of the
factious, on which account our escort was considerable.&nbsp; At
the distance of five or six leagues from <a
name="page1_363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>Lugo, our
guard, in lieu of regular soldiers, consisted of a body of about
fifty Miguelets.&nbsp; They had all the appearance of banditti,
but a finer body of ferocious fellows I never saw.&nbsp; They
were all men in the prime of life, mostly of tall stature, and of
Herculean brawn and limbs.&nbsp; They wore huge whiskers, and
walked with a fanfaronading air, as if they courted danger, and
despised it.&nbsp; In every respect they stood in contrast to the
soldiers who had hitherto escorted us, who were mere feeble boys
from sixteen to eighteen years of age, and possessed of neither
energy nor activity.&nbsp; The proper dress of the Miguelet, if
it resembles anything military, is something akin to that
anciently used by the English marines.&nbsp; They wear a peculiar
kind of hat, and generally leggings, or gaiters, and their arms
are the gun and bayonet.&nbsp; The colour of their dress is
mostly dark brown.&nbsp; They observe little or no discipline,
whether on a march or in the field of action.&nbsp; They are
excellent irregular troops, and when on actual service are
particularly useful as skirmishers.&nbsp; Their proper duty,
however, is to officiate as a species of police, and to clear the
roads of robbers, for which duty they are in one respect
admirably calculated, having been generally robbers themselves at
one period of their lives.&nbsp; Why these people are called
Miguelets <a name="citation363"></a><a href="#footnote363"
class="citation">[363]</a> it is not easy to say, but it is
probable that they have derived this appellation from the name of
their original leader.&nbsp; I regret that the paucity of my own
information will not allow me to enter into farther particulars
with respect to this corps, concerning which I have little doubt
that many remarkable things might be said.</p>
<p><a name="page1_364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>Becoming weary of the slow travelling of the post, I
determined to brave all risk, and to push forward.&nbsp; In this,
however, I was guilty of no slight imprudence, as by so doing I
was near falling into the hands of robbers.&nbsp; Two fellows
suddenly confronted me with presented carbines, which they
probably intended to discharge into my body, but they took fright
at the noise of Antonio&rsquo;s horse, who was following a little
way behind.&nbsp; This affair occurred at the bridge of
Castellanos, a spot notorious for robbery and murder, and well
adapted for both, for it stands at the bottom of a deep dell
surrounded by wild desolate hills.&nbsp; Only a quarter of an
hour previous, I had passed three ghastly heads stuck on poles
standing by the way-side; they were those of a captain of
banditti and two of his accomplices, who had been seized and
executed about two months before.&nbsp; Their principal haunt was
the vicinity of the bridge, and it was their practice to cast the
bodies of the murdered into the deep black water which runs
rapidly beneath.&nbsp; Those three heads will always live in my
remembrance, particularly that of the captain, which stood on a
higher pole than the other two: the long hair was waving in the
wind, and the blackened, distorted features were grinning in the
sun.&nbsp; The fellows whom I met were the relics of the
band.</p>
<p>We arrived at Betanzos late in the afternoon.&nbsp; This town
stands on a creek at some distance from the sea, and about three
leagues from Corunna.&nbsp; It is surrounded on three sides by
lofty hills.&nbsp; The weather during the greater part of the day
had been dull and lowering, and we found the atmosphere of
Betanzos insupportably close and heavy.&nbsp; Sour and
disagreeable odours assailed our olfactory organs from <a
name="page1_365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>all
sides.&nbsp; The streets were filthy&mdash;so were the houses,
and especially the <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; We entered the stable; it
was strewed with rotten seaweeds and other rubbish, in which pigs
were wallowing; huge and loathsome flies were buzzing
around.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pest-house!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
But we could find no other stable, and were therefore obliged to
tether the unhappy animals to the filthy mangers.&nbsp; The only
provender that could be obtained was Indian corn.&nbsp; At
nightfall I led them to drink at a small river which passes
through Betanzos.&nbsp; My <i>entero</i> swallowed the water
greedily; but as we returned towards the inn, I observed that he
was sad, and that his head drooped.&nbsp; He had scarcely reached
the stall, when a deep hoarse cough assailed him.&nbsp; I
remembered the words of the ostler in the mountains.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man must be mad who brings a horse to Galicia, and
doubly so he who brings an <i>entero</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the
greater part of the day the animal had been much heated, walking
amidst a throng of at least a hundred pony mares.&nbsp; He now
began to shiver violently.&nbsp; I procured a quart of anise <a
name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a> brandy, with which, assisted by
Antonio, I rubbed his body for nearly an hour, till his coat was
covered with a white foam; but his cough increased perceptibly,
his eyes were becoming fixed, and his members rigid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no remedy but bleeding,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Run for a farrier.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farrier came.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must bleed the horse,&rdquo; I shouted; &ldquo;take
from him an <i>azumbre</i> of blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farrier
looked at the animal, and made for the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
are you going?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we want you here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know you do,&rdquo; was his answer; &ldquo;and on that account <a
name="page1_366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>I am
going.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you must bleed the horse, or he
will die.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know he will,&rdquo; said the
farrier, &ldquo;but I will not bleed him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not bleed him
but under one condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it!&mdash;that you pay me an
ounce of gold.&rdquo; <a name="citation366a"></a><a
href="#footnote366a" class="citation">[366a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Run
upstairs for the red morocco case,&rdquo; said I to
Antonio.&nbsp; The case was brought; I took out a large fleam,
and with the assistance of a stone, drove it into the principal
artery of the horse&rsquo;s leg.&nbsp; The blood at first refused
to flow; at last, with much rubbing, it began to trickle, and
then to stream; it continued so for half an hour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The horse is fainting, <i>mon ma&icirc;tre</i>,&rdquo;
said Antonio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold him up,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
in another ten minutes we will stop the vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I closed the vein, and whilst doing so I looked up into the
farrier&rsquo;s face, arching my eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carracho</i>! <a name="citation366b"></a><a
href="#footnote366b" class="citation">[366b]</a> what an evil
wizard!&rdquo; <a name="citation366c"></a><a href="#footnote366c"
class="citation">[366c]</a> muttered the farrier as he walked
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had my knife here I would stick
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; We bled the horse again during the night, which
second bleeding I believe saved him.&nbsp; Towards morning he
began to eat his food.</p>
<p>The next day we departed for Corunna, leading our horses by
the bridle.&nbsp; The day was magnificent, and our walk
delightful.&nbsp; We passed along beneath tall umbrageous trees,
which skirted the road from Betanzos to within a short distance
of Corunna.&nbsp; Nothing could be more smiling and cheerful than
<a name="page1_367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>the
appearance of the country around.&nbsp; Vines were growing in
abundance in the vicinity of the villages through which we
passed, whilst millions of maize plants upreared their tall
stalks and displayed their broad green leaves in the
fields.&nbsp; After walking about three hours, we obtained a view
of the Bay of Corunna, in which, even at the distance of a
league, we could distinguish three or four immense ships riding
at anchor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can these vessels belong to Spain?&rdquo;
I demanded of myself.&nbsp; In the very next village, however, we
were informed that the preceding evening an English squadron had
arrived, for what reason nobody could say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; continued our informant, &ldquo;they have
doubtless some design upon Galicia.&nbsp; These foreigners are
the ruin of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We put up in what is called the Calle Real, in an excellent
<i>fonda</i>, or <i>posada</i>, kept by a short, thick,
comical-looking person, a Genoese by birth.&nbsp; He was married
to a tall, ugly, but good-tempered Basque woman, by whom he had
been blessed with a son and daughter.&nbsp; His wife, however,
had it seems of late summoned all her female relations from
Guipuzcoa, who now filled the house to the number of nine,
officiating as chambermaids, cooks, and scullions: they were all
very ugly, but good natured, and of immense volubility of
tongue.&nbsp; Throughout the whole day the house resounded with
their excellent Basque and very bad Castilian.&nbsp; The Genoese,
on the contrary, spoke little, for which he might have assigned a
good reason: he had lived thirty years in Spain, and had
forgotten his own language without acquiring Spanish, which he
spoke very imperfectly.</p>
<p><a name="page1_368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>We
found Corunna full of bustle and life, owing to the arrival of
the English squadron.&nbsp; On the following day, however, it
departed, being bound for the Mediterranean on a short cruise,
whereupon matters instantly returned to their usual course.</p>
<p>I had a dep&ocirc;t of five hundred Testaments at Corunna,
from which it was my intention to supply the principal towns of
Galicia.&nbsp; Immediately on my arrival I published
advertisements, according to my usual practice, and the book
obtained a tolerable sale&mdash;seven or eight copies per day on
the average.&nbsp; Some people, perhaps, on perusing these
details, will be tempted to exclaim, &ldquo;These are small
matters, and scarcely worthy of being mentioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
let such bethink them that till within a few months previous to
the time of which I am speaking, the very existence of the Gospel
was almost unknown in Spain, that it must necessarily be a
difficult task to induce a people like the Spaniards, who read
very little, to purchase a work like the New Testament, which,
though of paramount importance to the soul, affords but slight
prospect of amusement to the frivolous and carnally-minded.&nbsp;
I hoped that the present was the dawning of better and more
enlightened times, and rejoiced in the idea that Testaments,
though few in number, were being sold in unfortunate benighted
Spain, from Madrid to the furthermost parts of Galicia, a
distance of nearly four hundred miles.</p>
<p>Corunna stands on a peninsula, having on one side the sea, and
on the other the celebrated bay, generally called the Groyne. <a
name="citation368"></a><a href="#footnote368"
class="citation">[368]</a>&nbsp; It is divided into the <a
name="page1_369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>old and
new town, the latter of which was at one time probably a mere
suburb.&nbsp; The old town is a desolate ruinous place, separated
from the new by a wide moat.&nbsp; The modern town is a much more
agreeable spot, and contains one magnificent street, the Calle
Real, where the principal merchants reside.&nbsp; One singular
feature of this street is, that it is laid entirely with flags of
marble, along which troop ponies and cars as if it were a common
pavement.</p>
<p>It is a saying amongst the inhabitants of Corunna, that in
their town there is a street so clean that <i>puchera</i> <a
name="citation369a"></a><a href="#footnote369a"
class="citation">[369a]</a> may be eaten off it without the
slightest inconvenience.&nbsp; This may certainly be the fact
after one of those rains which so frequently drench Galicia, when
the appearance of the pavement of the street is particularly
brilliant.&nbsp; Corunna was at one time a place of considerable
commerce, the greater part of which has lately departed to
Santander, a town which stands a considerable distance down the
Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to St. James, <a
name="citation369b"></a><a href="#footnote369b"
class="citation">[369b]</a> <i>Giorgio</i>?&nbsp; If so, you will
perhaps convey a message to my poor countryman,&rdquo; said a
voice to me one morning in broken English, as I was standing at
the door of my <i>posada</i>, in the royal street of Corunna.</p>
<p><a name="page1_370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>I
looked round and perceived a man standing near me at the door of
a shop contiguous to the inn.&nbsp; He appeared to be about
sixty-five, with a pale face and remarkably red nose.&nbsp; He
was dressed in a loose green great-coat, in his mouth was a long
clay pipe, in his hand a long painted stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and who is your countryman?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you, however,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;you
purchased the first knife that I ever sold in the market-place of
N---.&rdquo; <a name="citation370a"></a><a href="#footnote370a"
class="citation">[370a]</a></p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Ah, I remember you now, Luigi Piozzi <a
name="citation370b"></a><a href="#footnote370b"
class="citation">[370b]</a>; and well do I remember also how,
when a boy, twenty years ago, I used to repair to your stall, and
listen to you and your countrymen discoursing in Milanese.</p>
<p><i>Luigi</i>.&mdash;Ah, those were happy times to me.&nbsp;
Oh, how they rushed back on my remembrance when I saw you ride up
to the door of the <i>posada</i>!&nbsp; I instantly went in,
closed my shop, lay down upon my bed and wept.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I see no reason why you should so much
regret those times.&nbsp; I knew you formerly in England as an
itinerant pedlar, and occasionally as master of a stall in the
market-place of a country town.&nbsp; I now find you in a seaport
of Spain, the proprietor, seemingly, of a considerable
shop.&nbsp; I cannot see why you should regret the
difference.</p>
<p><i>Luigi</i> (dashing his pipe on the ground).&mdash;Regret
the difference!&nbsp; Do you know one thing?&nbsp; England is the
heaven of the Piedmontese and Milanese, and especially those of
Como.&nbsp; We never lie down to <a name="page1_371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>rest but we dream of it, whether we
are in our own country or in a foreign land, as I am now.&nbsp;
Regret the difference, <i>Giorgio</i>!&nbsp; Do I hear such words
from your lips, and you an Englishman?&nbsp; I would rather be
the poorest tramper on the roads of England, than lord of all
within ten leagues of the shore of the lake of Como, and much the
same say all my countrymen who have visited England, wherever
they now be.&nbsp; Regret the difference!&nbsp; I have ten
letters from as many countrymen in America, who say they are rich
and thriving, and principal men and merchants; but every night,
when their heads are reposing on their pillows, their souls
<i>auslandra</i>, hurrying away to England, and its green lanes
and farmyards.&nbsp; And there they are with their boxes on the
ground, displaying their looking-glasses and other goods to the
hones, rustics and their dames and their daughters, and selling
away and chaffering and laughing just as of old.&nbsp; And there
they are again at nightfall in the hedge alehouses, eating their
toasted cheese and their bread, and drinking the Suffolk ale, and
listening to the roaring song and merry jests of the
labourers.&nbsp; Now, if they regret England so who are in
America, which they own to be a happy country, and good for those
of Piedmont and of Como, how much more must I regret it, when,
after the lapse of so many years, I find myself in Spain, in this
frightful town of Corunna, driving a ruinous trade, and where
months pass by without my seeing a single English face, or
hearing a word of the blessed English tongue!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;With such a predilection for England,
what could have induced you to leave it and come to Spain?</p>
<p><i>Luigi</i>.&mdash;I will tell you.&nbsp; About sixteen years
ago a <a name="page1_372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>universal desire seized our people in England to become
something more than they had hitherto been, pedlars and trampers;
they wished, moreover&mdash;for mankind are never
satisfied&mdash;to see other countries: so the greater part
forsook England.&nbsp; Where formerly there had been ten, at
present scarcely lingers one.&nbsp; Almost all went to America,
which, as I told you before, is a happy country, and specially
good for us men of Como.&nbsp; Well, all my comrades and
relations passed over the sea to the West.&nbsp; I too was bent
on travelling, but whither?&nbsp; Instead of going towards the
West with the rest, to a country where they have all thriven, I
must needs come by myself to this land of Spain; a country in
which no foreigner settles without dying of a broken heart sooner
or later.&nbsp; I had an idea in my head that I could make a
fortune at once, by bringing a cargo of common English goods,
like those which I had been in the habit of selling amongst the
villagers of England.&nbsp; So I freighted half a ship with such
goods, for I had been successful in England in my little
speculations, and I arrived at Corunna.&nbsp; Here at once my
vexations began: disappointment followed disappointment.&nbsp; It
was with the utmost difficulty that I could obtain permission to
land my goods, and this only at a considerable sacrifice in
bribes and the like; and when I had established myself here, I
found that the place was one of no trade, and that my goods went
off very slowly, and scarcely at prime cost.&nbsp; I wished to
remove to another place, but was informed that, in that case, I
must leave my goods behind, unless I offered fresh bribes, which
would have ruined me; and in this way I have gone on for fourteen
years, selling scarcely enough to pay for my shop and to support
myself.&nbsp; And so I shall <a name="page1_373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>doubtless continue till I die, or my
goods are exhausted.&nbsp; In an evil day I left England and came
to Spain.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Did you not say that you had a countryman
at St. James?</p>
<p><i>Luigi</i>.&mdash;Yes, a poor honest fellow who, like
myself, by some strange chance found his way to Galicia.&nbsp; I
sometimes contrive to send him a few goods, which he sells at St.
James at a greater profit than I can here.&nbsp; He is a happy
fellow, for he has never been in England, and knows not the
difference between the two countries.&nbsp; Oh, the green English
hedgerows! and the alehouses! and, what is much more, the fair
dealing and security.&nbsp; I have travelled all over England and
never met with ill usage, except once down in the north amongst
the Papists, upon my telling them to leave all their mummeries
and go to the parish church as I did, and as all my countrymen in
England did; for know one thing, <i>Signor Giorgio</i>, not one
of us who have lived in England, whether Piedmontese or men of
Como, but wished well to the Protestant religion, if he had not
actually become a member of it.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What do you propose to do at present,
Luigi?&nbsp; What are your prospects?</p>
<p><i>Luigi</i>.&mdash;My prospects are a blank, <i>Giorgio</i>;
my prospects are a blank.&nbsp; I propose nothing but to die in
Corunna, perhaps in the hospital, if they will admit me.&nbsp;
Years ago I thought of fleeing, even if I left all behind me, and
either returning to England, or betaking myself to America; but
it is too late now, <i>Giorgio</i>, it is too late.&nbsp; When I
first lost all hope I took to drinking, to which I was never
before inclined, and I am now what I suppose you see.</p>
<p><a name="page1_374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>&ldquo;There is hope in the Gospel,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;even for you.&nbsp; I will send you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a small battery of the old town which fronts the
east, and whose wall is washed by the waters of the bay.&nbsp; It
is a sweet spot, and the prospect which opens from it is
extensive.&nbsp; The battery itself may be about eighty yards
square; some young trees are springing up about it, and it is
rather a favourite resort of the people of Corunna.</p>
<p>In the centre of this battery stands the tomb of Moore, built
by the chivalrous French, in commemoration of the fall of their
heroic antagonist.&nbsp; It is oblong, and surmounted by a slab,
and on either side bears one of the simple and sublime epitaphs
for which our rivals are celebrated, and which stand in such
powerful contrast with the bloated and bombastic inscriptions
which deform the walls of Westminster Abbey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;JOHN MOORE,<br
/>
<span class="smcap">leader of the english armies</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">slain in battle</span>,<br />
1809.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tomb itself is of marble, and around it is a quadrangular
wall, breast-high, of rough Gallegan granite; close to each
corner rises from the earth the breech of an immense brass
cannon, intended to keep the wall compact and close.&nbsp; These
outer erections are, however, not the work of the French, but of
the English government.</p>
<p>Yes, there lies the hero, almost within sight of the glorious
hill where he turned upon his pursuers like a lion at bay and
terminated his career.&nbsp; Many acquire <a
name="page1_375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>immortality without seeking it, and die before its
first ray has gilded their name; of these was Moore.&nbsp; The
harassed general, flying through Castile with his dispirited
troops before a fierce and terrible enemy, little dreamed that he
was on the point of attaining that for which many a better,
greater, though certainly not braver man, had sighed in
vain.&nbsp; His very misfortunes were the means which secured him
immortal fame; his disastrous route, bloody death, and finally
his tomb on a foreign strand, far from kin and friends.&nbsp;
There is scarcely a Spaniard but has heard of this tomb, and
speaks of it with a strange kind of awe.&nbsp; Immense treasures
are said to have been buried with the heretic general, though for
what purpose no one pretends to guess.&nbsp; The demons of the
clouds, if we may trust the Gallegans, followed the English in
their flight, and assailed them with water-spouts as they toiled
up the steep winding paths of Fuencebadon, whilst legends the
most wild are related of the manner in which the stout soldier
fell.&nbsp; Yes, even in Spain, immortality has already crowned
the head of Moore;&mdash;Spain, the land of oblivion, where the
Guadalete, the ancient Lethe, <a name="citation375"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm">Compostella&mdash;Rey Romero&mdash;The
Treasure-seeker&mdash;Hopeful Project&mdash;The Church of
Refuge&mdash;Hidden Riches&mdash;The Canon&mdash;Spirit of
Localism&mdash;The Leper&mdash;Bones of Saint James.</p>
<p>At the commencement of August I found myself at Saint James of
Compostella.&nbsp; To this place I travelled from Corunna with
the courier or weekly post, who was escorted by a strong party of
soldiers, in consequence of the distracted state of the country,
which was overrun with banditti.&nbsp; From Corunna to Saint
James the distance is but ten leagues; the journey, however,
endured for a day and a half.&nbsp; It was a pleasant one,
through a most beautiful country, with a rich variety of hill and
dale; the road was in many places shaded with various kinds of
trees clad in most luxuriant foliage.&nbsp; Hundreds of
travellers, both on foot and on horseback, availed themselves of
the security which the escort afforded: the dread of banditti was
strong.&nbsp; During the journey two or three alarms were given;
we, however, reached Saint James without having been
attacked.</p>
<p>Saint James stands on a pleasant level amidst mountains: the
most extraordinary of these is a conical hill, called the Pico
Sacro, or Sacred Peak, connected <a name="page1_378"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 378</span>with which are many wonderful
legends.&nbsp; A beautiful old town is Saint James, containing
about twenty thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; Time has been when, with
the single exception of Rome, it was the most celebrated resort
of pilgrims in the world; its cathedral being said to contain the
bones of Saint James the elder, the child of the thunder, <a
name="citation378"></a><a href="#footnote378"
class="citation">[378]</a> who, according to the legend of the
Romish church, first preached the Gospel in Spain.&nbsp; Its
glory, however, as a place of pilgrimage, is rapidly passing
away.</p>
<p>The cathedral, though a work of various periods, and <a
name="page1_379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>exhibiting various styles of architecture, is a
majestic venerable pile, in every respect calculated to excite
awe and admiration; indeed, it is almost impossible to walk its
long dusk aisles, and hear the solemn music and the noble
chanting, and inhale the incense of the mighty censers, which are
at times swung so high by machinery as to smite the vaulted roof,
whilst gigantic tapers glitter here and there amongst the gloom,
from the shrine of many a saint, before which the worshippers are
kneeling, breathing forth their prayers and petitions for help,
love, and mercy, and entertain a doubt that we are treading the
floor of a house where God delighteth to dwell.&nbsp; Yet the
Lord is distant from that house; He hears not, He sees not, or if
He do, it is with anger.&nbsp; What availeth that solemn music,
that noble chanting, that incense of sweet savour?&nbsp; What
availeth kneeling before that grand altar of silver, surmounted
by that figure with its silver hat and breast-plate, the emblem
of one who, though an apostle and confessor, was at best an
unprofitable servant?&nbsp; What availeth hoping for remission of
sin by trusting in the merits of one who possessed none, or by
paying homage to others who were born and nurtured in sin, and
who alone, by the exercise of a lively faith granted from above,
could hope to preserve themselves from the wrath of the
Almighty?</p>
<p>Rise from your knees, ye children of Compostella, or, if ye
bend, let it be to the Almighty alone, and no longer on the eve
of your patron&rsquo;s day address him in the following strain,
however sublime it may sound:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou shield of that faith which in Spain we
revere,<br />
Thou scourge of each foeman who dares to draw near;<br />
Whom the Son of that God who the elements tames,<br />
Called child of the thunder, immortal Saint James!</p>
<p><a name="page1_380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>&ldquo;From the blessed asylum of glory intense,<br />
Upon us thy sovereign influence dispense;<br />
And list to the praises our gratitude aims<br />
To offer up worthily, mighty Saint James!</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thee fervent thanks Spain shall ever outpour;<br />
In thy name though she glory, she glories yet more<br />
In thy thrice hallowed corse, which the sanctuary claims<br />
Of high Compostella, O blessed Saint James!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When heathen impiety, loathsome and dread,<br />
With a chaos of darkness our Spain overspread,<br />
Thou wast the first light which dispelled with its flames<br />
The hell-born obscurity, glorious Saint James!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when terrible wars had nigh wasted our force,<br />
All bright &rsquo;midst the battle we saw thee on horse,<br />
Fierce scattering the hosts, whom their fury proclaims<br />
To be warriors of Islam, victorious Saint James!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath thy direction, stretched prone at thy feet,<br
/>
With hearts low and humble, this day we entreat<br />
Thou wilt strengthen the hope which enlivens our frames,<br />
The hope of thy favour and presence, Saint James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then praise to the Son and the Father above,<br />
And to that Holy Spirit which springs from their love;<br />
To that bright emanation whose vividness shames<br />
The sun&rsquo;s burst of splendour, and praise to Saint
James.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Saint James I met with a kind and cordial coadjutor in my
biblical labours in the bookseller of the place, Rey Romero, a
man of about sixty.&nbsp; This excellent individual, who was both
wealthy and respected, took up the matter with an enthusiasm
which doubtless emanated from on high, losing no opportunity of
recommending my book to those who entered his shop, which was in
the Azabacheria, <a name="citation380"></a><a href="#footnote380"
class="citation">[380]</a> and was a very <a
name="page1_381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>splendid
and commodious establishment.&nbsp; In many instances, when the
peasants of the neighbourhood came with an intention of
purchasing some of the foolish popular story-books of Spain, he
persuaded them to carry home Testaments instead, assuring them
that the sacred volume was a better, more instructive, and even
far more entertaining book than those they came in quest
of.&nbsp; He speedily conceived a great fancy for me, and
regularly came to visit me every evening at my <i>posada</i>, and
accompanied me in my walks about the town and the environs.&nbsp;
He was a man of considerable information, and though of much
simplicity, possessed a kind of good-natured humour which was
frequently highly diverting.</p>
<p>I was walking late one night alone in the <i>alameda</i> of
Saint James, considering in what direction I should next bend my
course, for I had been already ten days in this place; the moon
was shining gloriously, and illumined every object around to a
considerable distance.&nbsp; The <i>alameda</i> was quite
deserted; everybody, with the exception of myself, having for
some time retired.&nbsp; I sat down on a bench and continued my
reflections, which were suddenly interrupted by a heavy stumping
sound.&nbsp; Turning my eyes in the direction from which it
proceeded, I perceived what at first appeared a shapeless bulk
slowly advancing: nearer and nearer it drew, and I could now
distinguish the outline of a man dressed in coarse brown
garments, a kind of Andalusian hat, and using as a staff the long
peeled branch of a tree.&nbsp; He had now arrived opposite the
bench where I was seated, when, stopping, he took off his hat and
demanded charity in uncouth tones and in a strange jargon, which
had some resemblance to the Catalan.&nbsp; The moon shone on grey
locks <a name="page1_382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>and on a ruddy weather-beaten countenance which I at
once recognized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Benedict Mol,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;is it possible that I see you at Compostella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Och</i>, <i>mein Gott</i>, <i>es ist der
Herr</i>!&rdquo; <a name="citation382a"></a><a
href="#footnote382a" class="citation">[382a]</a> replied
Benedict.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Och</i>, what good fortune, that the
Herr is the first person I meet at Compostella!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I can scarcely believe my eyes.&nbsp; Do
you mean to say that you have just arrived at this place?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow yes, I am this moment arrived.&nbsp;
I have walked all the long way from Madrid.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;What motive could possibly bring you such
a distance?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow, I am come for the
<i>Schatz</i>&mdash;the treasure.&nbsp; I told you at Madrid that
I was coming; and now I have met you here, I have no doubt that I
shall find it, the <i>Schatz</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;In what manner did you support yourself
by the way?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow, I begged, I bettled, <a
name="citation382b"></a><a href="#footnote382b"
class="citation">[382b]</a> and so contrived to pick up some
<i>cuartos</i>; and when I reached Toro, I worked at my trade of
soap-making for a time, till the people said I knew nothing about
it, and drove me out of the town.&nbsp; So I went on and begged
and bettled till I arrived at Orense, which is in this country of
Galicia.&nbsp; Ow, I do not like this country of Galicia at
all.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Why not?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Why! because here they all beg and
bettle, and have scarce anything for themselves, much less for
me, whom they know to be a foreign man.&nbsp; Oh, the misery of
Galicia!&nbsp; When I arrive at night at one of their pigsties,
which they call <i>posadas</i>, and <a name="page1_383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>ask for bread to eat in the name of
God, and straw to lie down in, they curse me, and say there is
neither bread nor straw in Galicia: and sure enough, since I have
been here I have seen neither, only something that they call
<i>broa</i>, and a kind of reedy rubbish with which they litter
the horses: all my bones are sore since I entered Galicia.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;And yet you have come to this country,
which you call so miserable, in search of treasure?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow <i>yaw</i>, but the <i>Schatz</i> is
buried; it is not above ground; there is no money above ground in
Galicia.&nbsp; I must dig it up; and when I have dug it up I will
purchase a coach with six mules, and ride out of Galicia to
Lucerne; and if the <i>Herr</i> pleases to go with me, he shall
be welcome to go with me and the Schatz.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I am afraid that you have come on a
desperate errand.&nbsp; What do you propose to do?&nbsp; Have you
any money?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Not a <i>cuarto</i>; but I do not care
now I have arrived at St. James.&nbsp; The <i>Schatz</i> is nigh;
and I have, moreover, seen you, which is a good sign; it tells me
that the <i>Schatz</i> is still here.&nbsp; I shall go to the
best <i>posada</i> in the place, and live like a duke till I have
an opportunity of digging up the <i>Schatz</i>, when I will pay
all scores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;find
out some place in which to sleep, and endeavour to seek some
employment.&nbsp; In the mean time, here is a trifle with which
to support yourself; but as for the treasure which you have come
to seek, I believe it only exists in your own
imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave him a dollar and departed.</p>
<p>I have never enjoyed more charming walks than <a
name="page1_384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>in the
neighbourhood of Saint James.&nbsp; In these I was almost
invariably accompanied by my friend the good old
bookseller.&nbsp; The streams are numerous, and along their
wooded banks we were in the habit of straying and enjoying the
delicious summer evenings of this part of Spain.&nbsp; Religion
generally formed the topic of our conversation, but we not
unfrequently talked of the foreign lands which I had visited, and
at other times of matters which related particularly to my
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;We booksellers of Spain,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;are all liberals; we are no friends to the monkish
system.&nbsp; How indeed should we be friends to it?&nbsp; It
fosters darkness, whilst we live by disseminating light.&nbsp; We
love our profession, and have all more or less suffered for it;
many of us, in the times of terror, were hanged for selling an
innocent translation from the French or English.&nbsp; Shortly
after the Constitution was put down by Angoul&ecirc;me and the
French bayonets, <a name="citation384"></a><a href="#footnote384"
class="citation">[384]</a> I was obliged to flee from Saint James
and take refuge in the wildest part of Galicia, near
Corcuvion.&nbsp; Had I not possessed good friends, I should not
have been alive now; as it was, it cost me a considerable sum of
money to arrange matters.&nbsp; Whilst I was away, my shop was in
charge of the ecclesiastical officers.&nbsp; They frequently told
my wife that I ought to be burnt for the books which I had
sold.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, those times are past, and I hope
they will never return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, as we were walking through the streets of Saint James,
he stopped before a church and looked at it attentively.&nbsp; As
there was nothing remarkable in the appearance of this edifice, I
asked him what motive he had for taking such notice of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the <a name="page1_385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>days of the friars,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this church
was one of refuge, to which if the worst criminals escaped, they
were safe.&nbsp; All were protected there save the <i>negros</i>,
as they called us liberals.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Even murderers, I
suppose?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Murderers!&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;far worse criminals than they.&nbsp; By-the-by,
I have heard that you English entertain the utmost abhorrence of
murder.&nbsp; Do you in reality consider it a crime of very great
magnitude?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should we not?&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;For every other crime some reparation can
be made; but if we take away life, we take away all.&nbsp; A ray
of hope with respect to this world may occasionally enliven the
bosom of any other criminal, but how can the murderer
hope?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The friars were of another way of
thinking,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;they always looked
upon murder as a <i>friolera</i>; but not so the crime of
marrying your first cousin without dispensation, for which, if we
believe them, there is scarcely any atonement either in this
world or the next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three days after this, as we were seated in my
apartment in the <i>posada</i>, engaged in conversation, the door
was opened by Antonio, who, with a smile on his countenance, said
that there was a foreign gentleman below who desired to speak
with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show him up,&rdquo; I replied; whereupon
almost instantly appeared Benedict Mol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a most extraordinary person,&rdquo; said I to
the bookseller.&nbsp; &ldquo;You Galicians, in general, leave
your country in quest of money; he, on the contrary, is come
hither to find some.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rey Romero</i>.&mdash;And he is right.&nbsp; Galicia is by
nature the richest province in Spain, but the inhabitants are
very stupid, and know not how to turn the blessings which
surround them to any account; but as a proof <a
name="page1_386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>of what
may be made out of Galicia, see how rich the Catalans become who
have settled down here and formed establishments.&nbsp; There are
riches all around us, upon the earth and in the earth.</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow <i>yaw</i>, in the earth, that is
what I say.&nbsp; There is much more treasure below the earth
than above it.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Since I last saw you, have you discovered
the place in which you say the treasure is deposited?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Oh yes, I know all about it now.&nbsp;
It is buried &rsquo;neath the sacristy in the church of San
Roque.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;How have you been able to make that
discovery?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;I will tell you.&nbsp; The day after my
arrival I walked about all the city in quest of the church, but
could find none which at all answered to the signs which my
comrade who died in the hospital gave me.&nbsp; I entered
several, and looked about, but all in vain; I could not find the
place which I had in my mind&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; At last the
people with whom I lodge, and to whom I told my business, advised
me to send for a <i>meiga</i>.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;A <i>meiga</i>! <a
name="citation386"></a><a href="#footnote386"
class="citation">[386]</a>&nbsp; What is that?</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow! a <i>Haxweib</i>, a witch; the
Gallegos call them so in their jargon, of which I can scarcely
understand a word.&nbsp; So I consented, and they sent for the
<i>meiga</i>.&nbsp; Och! what a <i>Weib</i> is that
<i>meiga</i>!&nbsp; I never saw such a woman; she is as large as
myself, and has a face as round and red as the sun.&nbsp; She
asked me a great many questions in her Gallegan; <a
name="page1_387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>and when
I had told her all she wanted to know, she pulled out a pack of
cards and laid them on the table in a particular manner, and then
she said that the treasure was in the church of San Roque; and
sure enough, when I went to that church, it answered in every
respect to the signs of my comrade who died in the
hospital.&nbsp; Oh, she is a powerful <i>Hax</i>, that
<i>meiga</i>; she is well known in the neighbourhood, and has
done much harm to the cattle.&nbsp; I gave her half the dollar I
had from you for her trouble.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Then you acted like a simpleton; she has
grossly deceived you.&nbsp; But even suppose that the treasure is
really deposited in the church you mention, it is not probable
that you will be permitted to remove the floor of the sacristy to
search for it.</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;Ow, the matter is already well
advanced.&nbsp; Yesterday I went to one of the canons to confess
myself and to receive absolution and benediction; not that I
regard these things much, but I thought this would be the best
means of broaching the matter, so I confessed myself, and then I
spoke of my travels to the canon, and at last I told him of the
treasure, and proposed that if he assisted me we should share it
between us.&nbsp; Ow, I wish you had seen him; he entered at once
into the affair, and said that it might turn out a very
profitable speculation: and he shook me by the hand, and said
that I was an honest Swiss and a good Catholic.&nbsp; And I then
proposed that he should take me into his house and keep me there
till we had an opportunity of digging up the treasure
together.&nbsp; This he refused to do.</p>
<p><i>Rey Romero</i>.&mdash;Of that I have no doubt: trust one of
our canons for not committing himself so far until he sees very
good reason.&nbsp; These tales of treasure <a
name="page1_388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>are at
present rather too stale: we have heard of them ever since the
time of the Moors.</p>
<p><i>Benedict</i>.&mdash;He advised me to go to the
Captain-General and obtain permission to make excavations, in
which case he promised to assist me to the utmost of his
power.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Swiss departed, and I neither saw nor heard
anything further of him during the time that I continued at Saint
James.</p>
<p>The bookseller was never weary of showing me about his native
town, of which he was enthusiastically fond.&nbsp; Indeed, I have
never seen the spirit of localism, which is so prevalent
throughout Spain, more strong than at Saint James.&nbsp; If their
town did but flourish, the Santiagans seemed to care but little
if all others in Galicia perished.&nbsp; Their antipathy to the
town of Corunna was unbounded, and this feeling had of late been
not a little increased from the circumstance that the seat of the
provincial government had been removed from Saint James to
Corunna.&nbsp; Whether this change was advisable or not, it is
not for me, who am a foreigner, to say; my private opinion,
however, is by no means favourable to the alteration.&nbsp; Saint
James is one of the most central towns in Galicia, with large and
populous communities on every side of it, whereas Corunna stands
in a corner, at a considerable distance from the rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a pity that the <i>vecinos</i> of Corunna cannot
contrive to steal away from us our cathedral, even as they have
done our government,&rdquo; said a Santiagan; &ldquo;then,
indeed, they would be able to cut some figure.&nbsp; As it is,
they have not a church fit to say mass in.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
great pity, too, that they cannot remove our hospital,&rdquo;
would another exclaim; &ldquo;as it is, they are obliged to send
us their sick poor <a name="page1_389"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>wretches.&nbsp; I always think that
the sick of Corunna have more ill-favoured countenances than
those from other places; but what good can come from
Corunna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accompanied by the bookseller, I visited this hospital, in
which, however, I did not remain long, the wretchedness and
uncleanliness which I observed speedily driving me away.&nbsp;
Saint James, indeed, is the grand lazar-house for all the rest of
Galicia, which accounts for the prodigious number of horrible
objects to be seen in its streets, who have for the most part
arrived in the hope of procuring medical assistance, which, from
what I could learn, is very scantily and inefficiently
administered.&nbsp; Amongst these unhappy wretches I occasionally
observed the terrible leper, and instantly fled from him with a
&ldquo;God help thee,&rdquo; as if I had been a Jew of old.&nbsp;
Galicia is the only province of Spain where cases of leprosy are
still frequent; a convincing proof this that the disease is the
result of foul feeding, and an inattention to cleanliness, as the
Gallegans, with regard to the comforts of life and civilized
habits, are confessedly far behind all the other natives of
Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides a general hospital, we have likewise a
leper-house,&rdquo; said the bookseller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I
show it you?&nbsp; We have everything at Saint James.&nbsp; There
is nothing lacking; the very leper finds an inn
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no objection to your showing me
the house,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but it must be at a distance,
for enter it I will not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he conducted me
down the road which leads towards Padron <a
name="citation389"></a><a href="#footnote389"
class="citation">[389]</a> and Vigo, and pointing to two or three
huts, exclaimed, &ldquo;That is our <a name="page1_390"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>leper-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
appears a miserable place,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
accommodation may there be for the patients, and who attends to
their wants?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are left to
themselves,&rdquo; answered the bookseller, &ldquo;and probably
sometimes perish from neglect: the place at one time was endowed,
and had rents, which were appropriated to its support, but even
these have been sequestered during the late troubles.&nbsp; At
present, the least unclean of the lepers generally takes his
station by the road-side, and begs for the rest.&nbsp; See, there
he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough the leper, in his shining scales, and half
naked, was seated beneath a ruined wall.&nbsp; We dropped money
into the hat of the unhappy being, and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad disorder that,&rdquo; said my friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I confess that I, who have seen so many of them, am by no
means fond of the company of lepers.&nbsp; Indeed, I wish that
they would never enter my shop, as they occasionally do to
beg.&nbsp; Nothing is more infectious, as I have heard, than
leprosy.&nbsp; There is one very virulent species, however, which
is particularly dreaded here&mdash;the elephantine: those who die
of it should, according to law, be burnt, and their ashes
scattered to the winds, for if the body of such a leper be
interred in the field of the dead, the disorder is forthwith
communicated to all the corses even below the earth.&nbsp; Such
at least is our idea in these parts.&nbsp; Law-suits are at
present pending from the circumstance of elephantides having been
buried with the other dead.&nbsp; Sad is leprosy in all its
forms, but most so when elephantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of corses,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you believe
that the bones of Saint James are veritably interred at
Compostella?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>&ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; replied the old man;
&ldquo;you know as much of the matter as myself.&nbsp; Beneath
the high altar is a large stone slab or lid, which is said to
cover the mouth of a profound well, at the bottom of which it is
believed that the bones of the saint are interred; though why
they should be placed at the bottom of a well is a mystery which
I cannot fathom.&nbsp; One of the officers of the church told me
that at one time he and another kept watch in the church during
the night, one of the chapels having shortly before been broken
open and a sacrilege committed.&nbsp; At the dead of night,
finding the time hang heavy on their hands, they took a crowbar
and removed the slab, and looked down into the abyss below; it
was dark as the grave; whereupon they affixed a weight to the end
of a long rope, and lowered it down.&nbsp; At a very great depth
it seemed to strike against something dull and solid, like lead:
they supposed it might be a coffin; perhaps it was, but whose? is
the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a stay of about a fortnight at Saint James, we again
mounted our horses and proceeded in the direction of Vigo.&nbsp;
As we did not leave Saint James till late in the afternoon, we
travelled that day no farther than Padron, a distance of only
three leagues.&nbsp; This place is a small port, situate at the
extremity of a firth which communicates with the sea.&nbsp; It is
called, for brevity&rsquo;s sake, Padron, but its proper
appellation is <i>Villa del Padron</i>, or the town of the patron
saint; it having been, according to the legend, the principal
residence of Saint James during his stay in Galicia.&nbsp; By the
Romans it was termed Iria Flavia.&nbsp; It is a flourishing
little town, and carries on rather an extensive commerce, some of
its tiny barks occasionally finding their way across the Bay of
Biscay, and even so far as the Thames and London.</p>
<p>There is a curious anecdote connected with the skippers of
Padron, which can scarcely be considered as out of place here, as
it relates to the circulation <a name="page1_393"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 393</span>of the Scriptures.&nbsp; I was one
day in the shop of my friend the bookseller at Saint James, when
a stout good-humoured-looking priest entered.&nbsp; He took up
one of my Testaments, and forthwith burst into a violent fit of
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; demanded the
bookseller.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sight of this book reminds me of a
circumstance,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;About twenty
years ago, when the English first took it into their heads to be
very zealous in converting us Spaniards to their own way of
thinking, they distributed a great number of books of this kind
amongst the Spaniards who chanced to be in London; some of them
fell into the hands of certain skippers of Padron, and these good
folk, on their return to Galicia, were observed to have become on
a sudden exceedingly opinionated and fond of dispute.&nbsp; It
was scarcely possible to make an assertion in their hearing
without receiving a flat contradiction, especially when religious
subjects were brought on the carpet. <a name="citation393"></a><a
href="#footnote393" class="citation">[393]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
false,&rsquo; they would say; &lsquo;Saint Paul, in such a
chapter and in such a verse, says exactly the
contrary.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What can you know concerning what
Saint Paul or any other saint has written?&rsquo; the priests
would ask them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much more than you think,&rsquo;
they replied; &lsquo;we are no longer to be kept in darkness and
ignorance respecting these matters:&rsquo; and then they would
produce their books and read paragraphs, making such comments
that every person was scandalized; they cared nothing about the
Pope, and even spoke with irreverence of the bones of Saint
James.&nbsp; However, the matter was soon bruited about, and a
commission was despatched from our see to collect the books and
burn them.&nbsp; This was effected, and the skippers were either
punished or <a name="page1_394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>reprimanded, since which I have heard nothing more of
them.&nbsp; I could not forbear laughing when I saw these books;
they instantly brought to my mind the skippers of Padron and
their religious disputations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our next day&rsquo;s journey brought us to Pontevedra.&nbsp;
As there was no talk of robbers in these parts, we travelled
without any escort and alone.&nbsp; The road was beautiful and
picturesque, though somewhat solitary, especially after we had
left behind us the small town of Caldas.&nbsp; There is more than
one place of this name in Spain: the one of which I am speaking
is distinguished from the rest by being called Caldas de los
Reyes, <a name="citation394"></a><a href="#footnote394"
class="citation">[394]</a> or the warm baths of the kings.&nbsp;
It will not be amiss to observe that the Spanish <i>Caldas</i> is
synonymous with the Moorish <i>Alhama</i>, a word of frequent
occurrence both in Spanish and African topography.&nbsp; Caldas
seemed by no means undeserving of its name.&nbsp; It stands on a
confluence of springs, and the place when we arrived was crowded
with people who had come to enjoy the benefit of the
waters.&nbsp; In the course of my travels I have observed that
wherever warm springs are found, vestiges of volcanoes are sure
to be nigh; the smooth black precipice, the divided mountain, or
huge rocks standing by themselves on the plain or on the
hillside, as if Titans had been playing at bowls.&nbsp; This last
feature occurs near Caldas de los Reyes, the side of the mountain
which overhangs it in the direction of the south being covered
with immense granite stones, apparently at some ancient period
eructed from the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; From Caldas to
Pontevedra the route was hilly and fatiguing, the heat was
intense, and those clouds of flies, which constitute one of the
pests of Galicia, annoyed <a name="page1_395"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 395</span>our horses to such a degree that we
were obliged to cut down branches from the trees to protect their
heads and necks from the tormenting stings of these bloodthirsty
insects.&nbsp; Whilst travelling in Galicia at this period of the
year on horseback, it is always advisable to carry a fine net for
the protection of the animal, a sure and commodious means of
defence, which appears, however, to be utterly unknown in
Galicia, where, perhaps, it is more wanted than in any other part
of the world.</p>
<p>Pontevedra, upon the whole, is certainly entitled to the
appellation of a magnificent town, some of its public edifices,
especially the convents, being such as are nowhere to be found
but in Spain and Italy.&nbsp; It is surrounded by a wall of hewn
stone, and stands at the end of a creek into which the river
Levroz disembogues.&nbsp; It is said to have been founded by a
colony of Greeks, whose captain was no less a personage than
Teucer the Telamonian.&nbsp; It was in former times a place of
considerable commerce; and near its port are to be seen the ruins
of a <i>farol</i>, or lighthouse, said to be of great
antiquity.&nbsp; The port, however, is at a considerable distance
from the town, and is shallow and incommodious.&nbsp; The whole
country in the neighbourhood of Pontevedra is inconceivably
delicious, abounding with fruits of every description, especially
grapes, which in the proper season are seen hanging from the
<i>parras</i> <a name="citation395"></a><a href="#footnote395"
class="citation">[395]</a> in luscious luxuriance.&nbsp; An old
Andalusian author has said that it produces as many orange and
citron trees as the neighbourhood of Cordova.&nbsp; Its <a
name="page1_396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>oranges
are, however, by no means good, and cannot compete with those of
Andalusia.&nbsp; The Pontevedrans boast that their land produces
two crops every year, and that whilst they are gathering in one
they may be seen ploughing and sowing another.&nbsp; They may
well be proud of their country, which is certainly a highly
favoured spot.</p>
<p>The town itself is in a state of great decay, and,
notwithstanding the magnificence of its public edifices, we found
more than the usual amount of Galician filth and misery.&nbsp;
The <i>posada</i> was one of the most wretched description, and
to mend the matter, the hostess was a most intolerable scold and
shrew.&nbsp; Antonio having found fault with the quality of some
provision which she produced, she cursed him most immoderately in
the country language, which was the only one she spoke, and
threatened, if he attempted to breed any disturbance in her
house, to turn the horses, himself, and his master forthwith out
of doors.&nbsp; Socrates himself, however, could not have
conducted himself on this occasion with greater forbearance than
Antonio, who shrugged his shoulders, muttered something in Greek,
and then was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the notary public live?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; Now the notary public vended books, and to this
personage I was recommended by my friend at Saint James.&nbsp; A
boy conducted me to the house of <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Garcia, for
such was his name.&nbsp; I found him a brisk, active, talkative
little man of forty.&nbsp; He undertook with great alacrity the
sale of my Testaments, and in a twinkling sold two to a client
who was waiting in the office, and appeared to be from the
country.&nbsp; He was an enthusiastic patriot, but of course in a
local sense, for he cared for no other country than
Pontevedra.</p>
<p><a name="page1_397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>&ldquo;Those fellows of Vigo,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;say their town is a better one than ours, and that it is
more deserving to be the capital of this part of Galicia.&nbsp;
Did you ever hear such folly?&nbsp; I tell you what, friend, I
should not care if Vigo were burnt, and all the fools and rascals
within it.&nbsp; Would you ever think of comparing Vigo with
Pontevedra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I have
never been at Vigo, but I have heard say that the bay of Vigo is
the finest in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bay! my good sir; bay.&nbsp; Yes, the rascals have a
bay, and it is that bay of theirs which has robbed us of all our
commerce.&nbsp; But what needs the capital of a district with a
bay?&nbsp; It is public edifices that it wants, where the
provincial deputies can meet to transact their business; now, so
far from there being a commodious public edifice, there is not a
decent house in all Vigo.&nbsp; Bay! yes, they have a bay, but
have they water fit to drink?&nbsp; Have they a fountain?&nbsp;
Yes, they have, and the water is so brackish that it would burst
the stomach of a horse.&nbsp; I hope, my dear sir, that you have
not come all this distance to take the part of such a gang of
pirates as those of Vigo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not come to take their part,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;indeed, I was not aware that they wanted my assistance in
this dispute.&nbsp; I am merely carrying to them the New
Testament, of which they evidently stand in much need, if they
are such knaves and scoundrels as you represent them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Represent them, my dear sir!&nbsp; Does not the matter
speak for itself?&nbsp; Do they not say that their town is better
than ours, more fit to be the capital of a district? <i>que
disparate</i>! <i>que briboneria</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation397"></a><a href="#footnote397"
class="citation">[397]</a></p>
<p><a name="page1_398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>&ldquo;Is there a bookseller&rsquo;s shop at
Vigo?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;kept by an
insane barber.&nbsp; I am glad, for your sake, that it is broken
up, and the fellow vanished.&nbsp; He would have played you one
of two tricks; he would either have cut your throat with his
razor, under pretence of shaving you, or have taken your books
and never have accounted to you for the proceeds.&nbsp;
Bay!&nbsp; I never could see what right such an owl&rsquo;s nest
as Vigo has to a bay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No person could exhibit greater kindness to another than did
the notary public to myself, as soon as I had convinced him that
I had no intention of siding with the men of Vigo against
Pontevedra.&nbsp; It was now six o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
and he forthwith conducted me to a confectioner&rsquo;s shop,
where he treated me with an iced cream and a small cup of
chocolate.&nbsp; From hence we walked about the city, the notary
showing the various edifices, especially the Convent of the
Jesuits.&nbsp; &ldquo;See that front,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what
do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed to him the admiration which I really felt, and by
so doing entirely won the good notary&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose there is nothing like that at Vigo?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; He looked at me for a moment, winked, gave a short
triumphant chuckle, and then proceeded on his way, walking at a
tremendous rate.&nbsp; The <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Garcia was dressed
in all respects as an English notary might be; he wore a white
hat, brown frock coat, drab breeches buttoned at the knees, white
stockings, and well blacked shoes.&nbsp; But I never saw an
English notary walk so fast: it could scarcely be called walking;
it seemed more like a succession of galvanic leaps and
bounds.&nbsp; I found it impossible to keep up with him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where are you conducting me?&rdquo; I at last demanded,
quite breathless.</p>
<p><a name="page1_399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>&ldquo;To the house of the cleverest man in
Spain,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to whom I intend to introduce
you; for you must not think that Pontevedra has nothing to boast
of but its splendid edifices and its beautiful country; it
produces more illustrious minds than any other town in
Spain.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of the grand Tamerlane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but he did not come from
Pontevedra or its neighbourhood: he came from the steppes of
Tartary, near the river Oxus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did,&rdquo; replied the notary, &ldquo;but
what I mean to say is, that when Enrique the Third wanted an
ambassador to send to that African, the only man he could find
suited to the enterprise was a knight of Pontevedra, Don --- by
name. <a name="citation399"></a><a href="#footnote399"
class="citation">[399]</a>&nbsp; Let the men of Vigo contradict
that fact if they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered a large portal and ascended a splendid staircase,
at the top of which the notary knocked at a small door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is the gentleman to whom you are about to introduce
me?&rdquo; demanded I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Advocate ---,&rdquo; replied Garcia;
&ldquo;he is the cleverest man in Spain, and understands all
languages and sciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were admitted by a respectable-looking female, to all
appearance a housekeeper, who, on being questioned, informed us
that the Advocate was at home, and forthwith conducted us to an
immense room, or rather library, the walls being covered with
books, <a name="page1_400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>except in two or three places where hung some fine
pictures of the ancient Spanish school.&nbsp; There was a rich
mellow light in the apartment, streaming through a window of
stained glass, which looked to the west.&nbsp; Behind the table
sat the Advocate, on whom I looked with no little interest.&nbsp;
His forehead was high and wrinkled, and there was much gravity on
his features, which were quite Spanish.&nbsp; He was dressed in a
long robe, and might be about sixty.&nbsp; He sat reading behind
a large table, and on our entrance half raised himself, and bowed
slightly.</p>
<p>The notary public saluted him most profoundly, and, in an
under-voice, hoped that he might be permitted to introduce a
friend of his, an English gentleman, who was travelling through
Galicia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see him,&rdquo; said the Advocate,
&ldquo;but I hope he speaks Castilian, else we can have but
little communication; for, although I can read both French and
Latin, I cannot speak them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks, sir, almost as good Spanish,&rdquo; said the
notary, &ldquo;as a native of Pontevedra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives of Pontevedra,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;appear to be better versed in Gallegan than in Castilian,
for the greater part of the conversation which I hear in the
streets is carried on in the former dialect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last gentleman whom my friend Garcia introduced to
me,&rdquo; said the Advocate, &ldquo;was a Portuguese, who spoke
little or no Spanish.&nbsp; It is said that the Gallegan and
Portuguese are very similar, but when we attempted to converse in
the two languages, we found it impossible.&nbsp; I understood
little of what he said, whilst my Gallegan was quite
unintelligible to him.&nbsp; Can you understand our country
dialect?&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p><a name="page1_401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>&ldquo;Very little of it,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;which I believe chiefly proceeds from the peculiar accent
and uncouth enunciation of the Gallegans, for their language is
certainly almost entirely composed of Spanish and Portuguese
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are an Englishman,&rdquo; said the
Advocate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your countrymen have committed much damage
in times past in these regions, if we may trust our
histories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they sank your galleons, and
burnt your finest men-of-war in Vigo Bay, and, under old Cobham,
<a name="citation401a"></a><a href="#footnote401a"
class="citation">[401a]</a> levied a contribution of forty
thousand pounds sterling on this very town of
Pontevedra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any foreign power,&rdquo; interrupted the notary
public, &ldquo;has a clear right to attack Vigo, but I cannot
conceive what plea your countrymen could urge for distressing
Pontevedra, which is a respectable town, and could never have
offended them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Cavalier,&rdquo; said the Advocate,
&ldquo;I will show you my library.&nbsp; Here is a curious work,
a collection of poems, written mostly in Gallegan, by the curate
of Fruime. <a name="citation401b"></a><a href="#footnote401b"
class="citation">[401b]</a>&nbsp; He is our national poet, and we
are very proud of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped upwards of an hour with the Advocate, whose
conversation, if it did not convince me that he was the cleverest
man in Spain, was, upon the whole, highly interesting, and who
certainly possessed an extensive store of general information,
though he was by no means the profound philologist which the
notary had represented him to be.</p>
<p>When I was about to depart from Pontevedra in the <a
name="page1_402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>afternoon
of the next day, the <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Garcia stood by the side
of my horse, and, having embraced me, thrust a small pamphlet
into my hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;This book,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;contains a description of Pontevedra.&nbsp; Wherever you
go, speak well of Pontevedra.&rdquo;&nbsp; I nodded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear friend, I have heard
of your society, and will do my best to further its views.&nbsp;
I am quite disinterested, but if at any future time you should
have an opportunity of speaking in print of <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>
Garcia, the notary public of Pontevedra&mdash;you understand
me&mdash;I wish you would do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant afternoon&rsquo;s ride from Pontevedra to
Vigo, the distance being only four leagues.&nbsp; As we
approached the latter town, the country became exceedingly
mountainous, though scarcely anything could exceed the beauty of
the surrounding scenery.&nbsp; The sides of the hills were for
the most part clothed with luxuriant forests, even to the very
summits, though occasionally a flinty and naked peak would
present itself, rising to the clouds.&nbsp; As the evening came
on the route along which we advanced became very gloomy, the
hills and forests enwrapping it in deep shade.&nbsp; It appeared,
however, to be well frequented: numerous cars were creaking along
it, and both horsemen and pedestrians were continually passing
us.&nbsp; The villages were frequent.&nbsp; Vines, supported on
<i>parras</i>, were growing, if possible, in still greater
abundance than in the neighbourhood of Pontevedra.&nbsp; Life and
activity seemed to pervade everything.&nbsp; The hum of insects,
the cheerful bark of dogs, the rude songs of Galicia, were
blended together in pleasant symphony.&nbsp; So delicious was my
ride that I almost regretted when we entered the gate of
Vigo.</p>
<p><a name="page1_403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>The
town occupies the lower part of a lofty hill, which, as it
ascends, becomes extremely steep and precipitous, and the top of
which is crowned with a strong fort or castle.&nbsp; It is a
small compact place, surrounded with low walls; the streets are
narrow, steep, and winding, and in the middle of the town is a
small square.</p>
<p>There is rather an extensive <i>faubourg</i> extending along
the shore of the bay.&nbsp; We found an excellent <i>posada</i>,
kept by a man and woman from the Basque provinces, who were both
civil and intelligent.&nbsp; The town seemed to be crowded, and
resounded with noise and merriment.&nbsp; The people were making
a wretched attempt at an illumination, in consequence of some
victory lately gained, or pretended to have been gained, over the
forces of the Pretender.&nbsp; Military uniforms were glancing
about in every direction.&nbsp; To increase the bustle, a troop
of Portuguese players had lately arrived from Oporto, and their
first representation was to take place this evening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is the play to be performed in Spanish?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and on
that account every person is so eager to go, which would not be
the case if it were in a language which they could
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morning of the next day I was seated at breakfast in a
large apartment which looked out upon the <i>Plaza Mayor</i>, or
great square of the good town of Vigo.&nbsp; The sun was shining
very brilliantly, and all around looked lively and gay.&nbsp;
Presently a stranger entered, and, bowing profoundly, stationed
himself at the window, where he remained a considerable time in
silence.&nbsp; He was a man of very remarkable appearance, of
about thirty-five.&nbsp; His features were of perfect symmetry,
and I may almost say of perfect beauty.&nbsp; <a
name="page1_404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>His hair
was the darkest I had ever seen, glossy and shining; his eyes
large, black, and melancholy; but that which most struck me was
his complexion.&nbsp; It might be called olive, it is true, but
it was a livid olive.&nbsp; He was dressed in the very first
style of French fashion.&nbsp; Around his neck was a massive gold
chain, while upon his fingers were large rings, in one of which
was set a magnificent ruby.&nbsp; Who can that man be? thought
I&mdash;Spaniard or Portuguese; perhaps a Creole.&nbsp; I asked
him an indifferent question in Spanish, to which he forthwith
replied in that language, but his accent convinced me that he was
neither Spaniard nor Portuguese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume I am speaking to an Englishman, sir,&rdquo;
said he, in as good English as it was possible for one not an
Englishman to speak.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;You know me to be an Englishman; but I
should find some difficulty in guessing to what country you
belong.</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;May I take a seat?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;A singular question.&nbsp; Have you not
as much right to sit in the public apartment of an inn as
myself?</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;I am not certain of that.&nbsp; The
people here are not in general very gratified at seeing me seated
by their side.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Perhaps owing to your political opinions,
or to some crime which it may have been your misfortune to
commit.</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;I have no political opinions, and I am
not aware that I ever committed any particular crime.&nbsp; I am
hated for my country and my religion.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Perhaps I am speaking to a Protestant,
like myself?</p>
<p><a name="page1_405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;I am no Protestant.&nbsp; If I
were, they would be cautious here of showing their dislike, for I
should then have a government and a consul to protect me.&nbsp; I
am a Jew&mdash;a Barbary Jew, a subject of Abderrahman.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;If that be the case, you can scarcely
complain of being looked upon with dislike in this country, since
in Barbary the Jews are slaves.</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;In most parts, I grant you, but not
where I was born, which was far up the country, near the
deserts.&nbsp; There the Jews are free, and are feared, and are
as valiant men as the Moslems themselves; as able to tame the
steed, or to fire the gun.&nbsp; The Jews of our tribe are not
slaves, and I like not to be treated as a slave either by
Christian or Moor.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Your history must be a curious one; I
would fain hear it.</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;My history I shall tell to no
one.&nbsp; I have travelled much, I have been in commerce, and
have thriven.&nbsp; I am at present established in Portugal, but
I love not the people of Catholic countries, and least of all
these of Spain.&nbsp; I have lately experienced the most shameful
injustice in the <i>Aduana</i> of this town, and when I
complained, they laughed at me, and called me Jew.&nbsp; Wherever
he turns, the Jew is reviled, save in your country, and on that
account my blood always warms when I see an Englishman.&nbsp; You
are a stranger here.&nbsp; Can I do aught for you?&nbsp; You may
command me.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I thank you heartily, but I am in need of
no assistance.</p>
<p><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;Have you any bills?&nbsp; I will accept
them if you have.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;I have no need of assistance; but you may
do me a favour by accepting of a book.</p>
<p><a name="page1_406"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
406</span><i>Stranger</i>.&mdash;I will receive it with
thanks.&nbsp; I know what it is.&nbsp; What a singular
people!&nbsp; The same dress, the same look, the same book.&nbsp;
Pelham gave me one in Egypt.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; Your Jesus was
a good man, perhaps a prophet; but . . . farewell!</p>
<p>Well may the people of Pontevedra envy the natives of Vigo
their bay, with which, in many respects, none other in the world
can compare.&nbsp; On every side it is defended by steep and
sublime hills, save on the part of the west, where is the outlet
to the Atlantic; but in the midst of this outlet, up towers a
huge rocky wall, or island, which breaks the swell, and prevents
the billows of the western sea from pouring through in full
violence.&nbsp; On either side of this island is a passage, so
broad that navies might pass through at all times in
safety.&nbsp; The bay itself is oblong, running far into the
land, and so capacious that a thousand sail of the line might
ride in it uncrowded.&nbsp; The waters are dark, still, and deep,
without quicksands or shallows, so that the proudest man-of-war
might lie within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the town ramparts
without any fear of injuring her keel.</p>
<p>Of many a strange event, and of many a mighty preparation, has
this bay been the scene.&nbsp; It was here that the bulky dragons
of the grand Armada were mustered; and it was from hence that,
fraught with the pomp, power, and terror of Old Spain, the
monster fleet, spreading its enormous sails to the wind, and bent
on the ruin of the Lutheran isle, proudly steered;&mdash;that
fleet, to build and man which half the forests of Galicia had
been felled, and all the mariners impressed from the thousand
bays and creeks of the stern Cantabrian shore.&nbsp; It was here
that the united flags of Holland and England triumphed over the
pride of Spain <a name="page1_407"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
407</span>and France; when the burning timbers of exploded
war-ships soared above the tops of the Gallegan hills, and
blazing galleons sank with their treasure-chests whilst drifting
in the direction of Sampayo.&nbsp; It was on the shores of this
bay that the English guards first emptied Spanish <i>bodegas</i>,
whilst the bombs of Cobham were crushing the roofs of the castle
of Castro, and the <i>vecinos</i> of Pontevedra buried their
doubloons in cellars, and flying posts were conveying to Lugo and
Orense the news of the heretic invasion and the disaster of
Vigo.&nbsp; All these events occurred to my mind as I stood far
up the hill, at a short distance from the fort, surveying the
bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, Cavalier?&rdquo; roared
several voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay, <i>Carracho</i>! if you
attempt to run we will shoot you!&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked round and
saw three or four fellows in dirty uniforms, to all appearance
soldiers, just above me, on a winding path, which led up the
hill.&nbsp; Their muskets were pointed at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
am I doing?&nbsp; Nothing, as you see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;save
looking at the bay; and as for running, this is by no means
ground for a course.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are our
prisoner,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;and you must come with us to
the fort.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just thinking of going
there,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;before you thus kindly invited
me.&nbsp; The fort is the very spot I was desirous of
seeing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thereupon climbed up to the place where
they stood, when they instantly surrounded me, and with this
escort I was marched into the fort, which might have been a
strong place in its time, but was now rather ruinous.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are suspected of being a spy,&rdquo; said the
corporal, who walked in front.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the corporal, &ldquo;and
several spies have lately been taken and shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page1_408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>Upon one of the parapets of the fort stood a young man,
dressed as a subaltern officer, and to this personage I was
introduced.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been watching you this
half-hour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as you were taking
observations.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you gave yourselves much
useless trouble,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am an Englishman,
and was merely looking at the bay.&nbsp; Have the kindness now to
show me the fort.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>After some conversation, he said, &ldquo;I wish to be civil to
people of your nation; you may therefore consider yourself at
liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; I bowed, made my exit, and proceeded down
the hill.&nbsp; Just before I entered the town, however, the
corporal, who had followed me unperceived, tapped me on the
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must go with me to the
governor,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo;
I replied.&nbsp; The governor was shaving when we were shown up

his hand.&nbsp; He looked very ill-natured, which was perhaps
owing to his being thus interrupted in his toilet.&nbsp; He asked
me two or three questions, and on learning that I had a passport,
and was the bearer of a letter to the English consul, he told me
that I was at liberty to depart.&nbsp; So I bowed to the governor

409</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>THE JEWS IN LISBON.<br />
<i>Chap. v. p.</i> 67.</h3>
<p>In the early editions this chapter ended as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>I found them a vile, infamous rabble, about two hundred in
number.&nbsp; With a few exceptions, they consist of
<i>escapados</i> from the Barbary shore, from Tetuan, from
Tangier, but principally from Mogadore; fellows who have fled to
a foreign land from the punishment due to their misdeeds.&nbsp;
Their manner of life in Lisbon is worthy of such a goodly
assemblage of <i>amis r&eacute;unis</i>.&nbsp; The generality of
them pretend to work in gold and silver, and keep small peddling
shops; they, however, principally depend for their livelihood on
an extensive traffic in stolen goods which they carry on.&nbsp;
It is said that there is honour among thieves, but this is
certainly not the case with the Jews of Lisbon, for they are so
greedy and avaricious, that they are constantly quarrelling about
their ill-gotten gain, the result being that they frequently ruin
each other.&nbsp; Their mutual jealousy is truly
extraordinary.&nbsp; If one, by cheating and roguery, gains a
<i>cruzado</i> in the presence of another, the latter instantly
says, &ldquo;I cry halves,&rdquo; and if the first refuse he is
instantly threatened with an information.&nbsp; The manner in
which they cheat each other has, with all its infamy,
occasionally something extremely droll and ludicrous.&nbsp; I was
one day in the shop of a <i>Swiri</i>, or Jew of Mogadore, when a
Jew from Gibraltar entered, with a Portuguese female, who held in
her hand a mantle, richly embroidered with gold.</p>
<p><i>Gibraltar Jew</i> (speaking in broken Arabic).&mdash;Good
day, O <a name="page1_410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span><i>Swiri</i>; God has favoured me this day; here is a
bargain by which we shall both gain.&nbsp; I have bought this
mantle of the woman almost for nothing, for it is stolen; but I
am poor, as you know, I have not a <i>cruzado</i>; pay her
therefore the price, that we may then forthwith sell the mantle
and divide the gain.</p>
<p><i>Swiri</i>.&mdash;Willingly, brother of Gibraltar; I will
pay the woman for the mantle; it does not appear a bad one.</p>
<p>Thereupon he flung two <i>cruzados</i> to the woman, who
forthwith left the shop.</p>
<p><i>Gibraltar Jew</i>.&mdash;Thanks, brother <i>Swiri</i>; this
is very kind of you.&nbsp; Now let us go and sell the mantle, the
gold alone is well worth a <i>moidore</i>.&nbsp; But I am poor,
and have nothing to eat; give me, therefore, the half of that sum
and keep the mantle; I shall be content.</p>
<p><i>Swiri</i>.&mdash;May Allah blot out your name, you
thief!&nbsp; What mean you by asking me for money?&nbsp; I bought
the mantle of the woman and paid for it.&nbsp; I know nothing of
you.&nbsp; Go out of my doors, dog of a Nazarene; if not, I will
pay you with a kick.</p>
<p>The dispute was referred to one of the <i>sabios</i>, or
priests; but the <i>sabio</i>, who was also from Mogadore, at
once took the part of the <i>Swiri</i>, and decided that the
other should have nothing.&nbsp; Whereupon the Gibraltar Jew
cursed the <i>sabio</i>, his father, mother, and all his
family.&nbsp; The <i>sabio</i> replied, &ldquo;I put you in
<i>nduis</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;a kind of purgatory or hell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I put you in seven <i>nduis</i>,&rdquo; retorted the
incensed Jew, over whom, however, superstitious fear speedily
prevailed; he faltered, became pale, and dropping his voice,
retreated, trembling in every limb.</p>
<p>The Jews have two synagogues in Lisbon, both are small; one
is, however, tolerably well furnished, it has its reading-desk,
and in the middle there is a rather handsome chandelier; the
other is little better than a sty, filthy to a degree, without
ornament of any kind.&nbsp; The congregation of this last are
thieves to a man; no Jew of the slightest respectability ever
enters it.</p>
<p>How well do superstition and crime go hand in hand!&nbsp;
These wretched beings break the eternal commandments of their
Maker without scruple; but they will not partake of the beast of
the uncloven foot, and the fish which has no scales.&nbsp; They
pay no regard to the denunciations of holy prophets against the
children of sin, but they quake at the sound of a dark <a
name="page1_411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>cabalistic word pronounced by one perhaps their equal
or superior in villainy; as if God would delegate the exercise of
his power to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>I was one day sauntering along the <i>Caesodr&eacute;</i>,
when a Jew, with whom I had previously exchanged a word or two,
came up and addressed me.</p>
<p><i>Jew</i>.&mdash;The blessing of God upon you, brother; I
know you to be a wise and powerful man, and I have conceived much
regard for you; it is on that account that I wish to put you in
the way of gaining much money.&nbsp; Come with me, and I will
conduct you to a place where there are forty chests of tea.&nbsp;
It is a <i>sereka</i>, and the thieves are willing to dispose of
it for a trifle; for there is search being made, and they are in
much fear.&nbsp; I can raise one-half of what they demand, do you
supply the other, we will then divide it, each shall go his own
way and dispose of his portion.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&mdash;Wherefore, O son of Arbat, do you propose
this to me, who am a stranger?&nbsp; Surely you are mad.&nbsp;
Have you not your own people about you whom you know, and in whom
you can confide?</p>
<p><i>Jew</i>.&mdash;It is because I know our people here that I
do not confide in them; we are in the <i>galoot</i> of sin.&nbsp;
Were I to confide in my brethren there would be a dispute, and
perhaps they would rob me, and few of them have any money.&nbsp;
Were I to apply to the <i>sabio</i> he might consent, but when I
ask for my portion he would put me in <i>ndui</i>.&nbsp; You I do
not fear; you are good, and would do me no harm, unless I
attempted to deceive you, and that I dare not do, for I know you
are powerful.&nbsp; Come with me, master, for I wish to gain
something, that I may return to Arbat, where I have children. . .

<p>Such are Jews in Lisbon.</p>

Badajoz was besieged by the French in 1808 and in 1809, and again
in 1811, when it surrendered, March 11, to Soult.&nbsp; It was
thrice besieged by Wellington; first on April 20, 1811; next in
May and June of the same year; and thirdly, in the spring of
1812, when he captured the city by storm, on the night of April
6, after a murderous contest, and a loss, during the twenty
days&rsquo; siege, of 72 officers and 963 men killed, and 306
officers and 3483 men wounded.&nbsp; The province of Badajoz has

uncertain where the missionary Joao Ferreira d&rsquo;Almeida made
this translation; probably in Ceylon.&nbsp; The place and date of
his death are equally uncertain.&nbsp; His translation, revised
by more than one Dutch scholar, was finally printed in 1712 at
Amsterdam, at the cost of the Dutch East India Company.&nbsp;
When the British and Foreign Bible Society first undertook the
publication of the Bible in Portuguese in the years
1809&ndash;1810, this version of Almeida was selected; but the
objections made to its accuracy were so numerous that in 1818,
and again in 1821, a reprint of Pereira&rsquo;s translation was
adopted in its place.</p>

<p>The cathedral referred to by Borrow was finished about 1300,

(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 25), when the southern
<i>Astures</i> first became subject to Rome.&nbsp; But a far more
ancient origin is claimed for the city, which was traditionally
founded by <i>Astur</i>, the son of Memnon (see Silius Italicus,
iii. 334; Martial, xiv. 199).&nbsp; The surrounding country of
the <i>Astures</i> was celebrated at once for the riches of its
gold-mines and for its breed of horses, whence the Latin

never been ascertained.&nbsp; Some consider them to be a remnant
of the Celtiberians, others of the Visigoths; most, however,
prefer a Bedouin or caravan descent.&nbsp; It is in vain to
question these ignorant carriers as to their history or origin,
for, like the gypsies, they have no traditions and know
nothing.&nbsp; <i>Arrieros</i>, at all events, they are, and that
word, in common with so many others relating to the barb and
carrier-caravan craft, is Arabic, and proves whence the system
and science were derived by Spaniards.&nbsp; Where George Borrow
and Richard Ford are so uncertain, it is assuredly unbecoming to
dogmatize.&nbsp; Mariana (vol. i. lib. vii. cap. 7), speaking of
King Mauregato, who is supposed, as much from his name as from
anything else, to have been an illegitimate son of Alfonso I. by
a <i>Moorish</i> lady, seeks to trace the origin of the Maragatos
as being more especially the subjects of Mauregato, but it is
rather an extravagant fancy than an explanation.</p>
<p>Monsieur Francisque Michel, in his <i>Races Maudites de la
France et de l&rsquo;Espagne</i> (Paris, 1847), has nothing to
say of these Maragatos, though he notices (ii. 41&ndash;44) a
smaller tribe, the <i>Vaqueros</i>, of the neighbouring Asturias,
whose origin is also enveloped in mystery.&nbsp; See De Rochas,
<i>Les Parias de France et l&rsquo;Espagne</i>, p. 120.&nbsp;
[The <i>Cagots</i> were also found in northwest Spain as well as
in France, but not, as far as we know, to the west of

confines of the district of El Vierzo, one of the most
interesting and least explored parts of the Peninsula, the
Switzerland of Leon, a district of Alpine passes, trout streams,
pleasant meadows, and groves of chestnuts and walnuts.&nbsp;
Bembibre, pop. 500, lies with its old castle on the trout-streams
Noceda and Boeza, amid green meadows, gardens, and vineyards,
whose wines were far more fatal to Moore&rsquo;s soldiers than
the French sabres.&nbsp; So much for Bembibre&mdash;<i>bene
bibere</i>.&nbsp; Ponferrada (<i>Interamnium Flavium</i>), which
is not entered, rises to the left on the confluence of the Sil
and Boeza.&nbsp; The bridge (<i>Pons-ferrata</i>) was built in
the eleventh century, for the passage of pilgrims to Compostella,
who took the direct route along the Sil by Val de Orras and
Orense.&nbsp; The town afterwards belonged to the Templars, and
was protected by the miraculous image of the Virgin, which was
found in an oak, and hence is called <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de
la Encina</i>; it is still the Patroness of the Vierzo
(Murray&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Spain</i>, 1st edit. p. 595).</p>
<p>The Vierzo extends about 10 leagues east and west by 8 north
and south.&nbsp; This amphitheatre is shut out from the world by
lofty snow-capped mountains, raised, as it were, by the hand of
some genii to enclose a simple valley of Rasselas.&nbsp; The
great Asturian chain slopes from Leitariegos to the south-west,
parting into two offshoots; that of El Puerto de Rabanal, and
Fuencebadon (<i>Fons Sabatonis</i>) constitute the east barrier,
and the other, running by the Puertos de Cebrero and Aguiar,
forms the frontier; while to the south the chains of the Sierras
de Segundera, Sanabria, and Cabrera complete the base of the
triangle.&nbsp; Thus hemmed in by a natural circumvallation, the
concavity must be descended into from whatever side it be
approached; this crater, no doubt, was once a large lake, the
waters of which have burst a way out, passing through the narrow
gorge of the Sil by Val de Orras, just as the Elbe forms the only
spout or outlet to hill-walled-in Bohemia, the <i>kettle-land</i>
of Germany (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 597).</p>

partisans or followers of the Infante Don Miguel, the absolutist
leader in the dreary civil war which ravaged Portugal from
1823&ndash;1834.&nbsp; It was their custom to escape into Spain
when attacked by the Constitutional forces in Portugal, and
nothing but Mr. Canning&rsquo;s bold action in sending an English
army to Lisbon in December, 1826, prevented their being utilized
by both Spain and France for the overthrow of Queen Maria in
Portugal (see Alison, <i>History of Europe</i>, vol. iv. ch. xxi.
s. 50).&nbsp; But as &ldquo;Miguelets,&rdquo; part refugees, part
rebels, part brigands, these bands of military ruffians were the
terror of the frontier districts of Spain and Portugal for many
years after the conclusion of the civil war in Portugal.</p>

religious poem of Alfonso X., <i>Los Loores y Milagros de Nuestra

national language was hardly formed, was written in Galician,
though from the beginning of the fourteenth to the middle of the
nineteenth century little attention was paid to the literary
language.&nbsp; Within the last few years a species of provincial
revival has taken place, and the following works among others
have been published in and about the language of Galicia: (1) D.
Juan Saco Arce, <i>Gramatica Gallega</i> (Lugo, 1868), with an
appendix of proverbs and popular songs; (2) Fernandez y Morales,

<i>Bracara Augusta</i>, or Braga, was the chief town and seat of
a <i>Conventus Juridicus</i> of southern Galicia, the Minho being
the boundary of the northern and southern divisions of the
province.</p>
<p>Roman Spain was at no time a province, but included, from
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 205 to <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 325, many provinces, each with its own
provincial capital.&nbsp; In the division of the Roman world by
Constantine, Hispania first became an administrative unit as a
diocese in the Prefecture of Gaul, with its capital at
<i>Hispalis</i> or Seville, the residence of the Imperial Vicar
(see Burke&rsquo;s <i>History of Spain</i>, vol. i. pp. 31, 35,

<p>Borrow, in fact, followed almost exactly the line of the
celebrated retreat of Sir John Moore, as may be seen by referring
to the map.&nbsp; Moore, leaving the plain country, and provoked
by the ignorant taunts of Frere to abandon his own plan of
marching in safety south-west into Portugal, found himself on the
28th of December, 1808, at Benavente; on the 29th, at Astorga; on
the 31st, at Villafranca del Vierzo; and thence, closely pressed
day by day by the superior forces of Soult, he passed through
Bembibre, Cacabelos, Herrerias, Nogales, to Lugo, whence, by way
of Betanzos, he arrived on the 11th of January at Corunna.&nbsp;
The horrors of that winter march over the frozen mountains will
never fully be known; they are forgotten in the glorious, if
bootless, victory on the sea-coast, and the heroic death of
Moore.&nbsp; The most authoritative account of Sir John
Moore&rsquo;s retreat, and of the battle of Corunna, is to be
found in the first volume of Napier&rsquo;s <i>Peninsular
War</i>; but the raciest is certainly that in the first edition
of Murray&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Spain</i>, by Richard Ford.</p>

class="footnote">[378]</a>&nbsp; A shepherd, we are told,
watching his flock in a wild mountain district in Galicia, was
astonished at the appearance of a supernatural light.&nbsp; The
Bishop of <i>Iria Flavia</i> (Padron) was consulted.&nbsp; The
place so divinely illuminated was carefully searched, and in a
marble sarcophagus, the body of Saint James the Greater was
revealed to the faithful investigators.&nbsp; The king, overjoyed
at the discovery, at once erected upon the ground thus
consecrated a church or chapel dedicated to the apostle&mdash;the
forerunner of the noble cathedral of Santiago de Compostella, and
from the first, the favourite resort of the pilgrims of Christian
Europe.&nbsp; For it was not only a relic, but a legend that had
been discovered by the pious doctors of the church.</p>
<p>Saint James, it was said, had certainly preached and taught in
Spain during his lifetime.&nbsp; His body, after his martyrdom at
Jerusalem in the year of Christ 42, had been placed by his
disciples on board a ship, by which it was conveyed to the coast
of his beloved Spain, miraculously landed in Galicia, and
forgotten for eight hundred years, until the time was
accomplished when it should be revealed to the devoted subjects
of King Alfonso the Chaste.&nbsp; The date of the discovery of
the precious remains is given by Ferreras as 808, by Morales as
835.&nbsp; But as it was Charlemagne who obtained from Leo III.
the necessary permission or faculty to remove the Episcopal See
of <i>Iria Flavia</i> to the new town of Compostella, the
discovery or invention must have taken place at least before 814,
the year of the death of the emperor.&nbsp; Whatever may have
been the actual date of its first establishment; the mean church
with mud walls soon gave place to a noble cathedral, which was
finished by the year 874, consecrated in 899, and destroyed by
the Arabs under Almanzor, nigh upon a hundred years afterwards,
in 997.&nbsp; See also Murray&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Spain</i>,

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
